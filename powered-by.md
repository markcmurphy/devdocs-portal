Powered By is an API-focused product that enables partners to seamlessly provide the BigCommerce solution to their merchants alongside their own product offering. 

Through the use of our public APIs, partners can:
* Manage the lifecycle of accounts and stores
* Build a fully customizable onboarding flow that meets the needs of their own platform experience
* Bill their merchants directly for BigCommerce services
* Auto install BigCommerce apps when a store is created via API.

Within this document, you will find an overview of the solution and troubleshooting information to assist as you integrate to each endpoint. For a complete endpoint reference, see the [Powered-By API Reference](/reference)
