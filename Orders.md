## Orders
The Order object contains a record of the purchase agreement between a shopper and a merchant. To learn more about creating orders, see [Orders Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/orders/orders-overview).

## Order Currency Fields

* `currency_code` - the display currency used to present prices to the shopper on the storefront.
* `currency_exchange_rate`: the exchange rate between the store's default currency and the display currency; when the order is created by means of the V2 endpoints, this value is always 1 (only in the storefront this value can be different to 1).

The following additional fields are returned on orders when Multi-Currency is enabled on the store:

* `store_default_currency_code` - the store's default currency
* `store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate` - the exchange rate between the store's default currency and the transactional currency used in the order.

**Example:**

```json
{
  ...
  "currency_id": 4,
  "currency_code": "EUR",
  "currency_exchange_rate": 1,
  "default_currency_id": 4,
  "default_currency_code": "EUR",
  "store_default_currency_codev": "USD",
  "store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate": "100.0000000000"
  ...
}

```

## Order Transactions
v3
The `/orders/{id}/transactions` endpoint returns details about the payment instruments used to pay for an order. Depending on the payment method used, different details will be available. Not all credit card payment gateways will return full card details or all CVV/fraud response details. This is primarily used to get detailed gateway response information for credit card transactions, however it will also return any available information about digital wallet payments, as well as details about orders paid (partially or in full) via a gift certificate or store credit. The test payment gateway available in the BigCommerce control panel does not return any payment information.

Orders processed via all payment providers except PayPal Express Checkout and Test Gateway will create a transaction that is retrievable via Transactions API. Gift certificates, store credit, and offline payment methods will not create a transaction.
