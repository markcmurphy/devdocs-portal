The minimum parameters to create a product are: name, price, category, type and weight. \n\n* **Name**: The name of your product as a string.\n* **Price**: How much the items costs in number format. \n* **Category**: The `{category_id}` for the category this product belongs to. An item can be assigned to more than one category. You can /GET the category id by using:\n\n`https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/catalog/categories`\n\n* **Type**: Is the item physical or digital?\n\t- Physical items are anything that is shipped to the customer, such as a t-shirt.\n\t- Digital items are products that the customer downloads, such as a PDF of an ebook. \n* **Weight**: How much the product weighs as a number. The measurement unit is determined by the [store settings](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-Settings#physical). \n\nReview the information pre-populated in the Body tab below. Make sure to run a GET request for the categories first and update request with the appropriate category ID."

                              * Check the Client ID and Client Token.

                              * Make sure your request headers are correct.

                              * Be sure you replaced `{store_hash}` with your
                              store hash. 

                              * Make sure the request url is correct.


                              Did you get a 200 but nothing was returned?

                              * Make sure your store has products.


                              Did you get a status of 404?

                              * Check the request url for errors.

                              ## What are OAuth Credentials?


                              BigCommerce uses [OAuth
                              authentication](https://dev.to/anabella/dancing-with-oauth-emp)
                              for all API and app usage. Currently, there are
                              two workflows to generate tokens, with different
                              use cases. 


                              ### API Credentials

                              Credentials for making API requests are created in
                              the control panel and can only be created by the
                              store owner. Tokens created manually through the
                              control panel are referred to in this
                              documentation as API Credentials to distinguish
                              them from tokens created programmatically. API
                              Credentials are used for testing purposes and
                              authenticating scripts, and they are tied solely
                              to the store used to generate them.


                              ### Client ID and Client Secret

                              Credentials for creating apps for sale in the
                              marketplace or private apps are created in [Dev
                              Tools](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com), the
                              developer workspace for managing apps. They are
                              referred to as Client ID and Client Secret in this
                              documentation.  The Client ID and Client Secret
                              are used by an app to generate an authorization
                              token per store. This allows your app to generate
                              an Oauth token programmatically, eliminating the
                              need to have a merchant manually generate API
                              Credentials to connect an app to their store and
                              allowing your app to generate tokens for multiple
                              stores with a single Client ID and Secret.

                              ## Getting API Credentials

                              You can create and manage API Credentials in the
                              BigCommerce control panel by creating an API
                              account, as described below. Only the store owner
                              can create API accounts; accounts are limited to
                              50 per store.


                              To create your API account and its corresponding
                              token, use the following steps:

                              1. Log into the store, using the store owner’s
                              username/password.

                              2. Select **Advanced Settings**.

                              3. Select **API Accounts**. This will display the
                              Store API Accounts page.

                              4. Select **Create API Account**. This will
                              display the Create API Account page shown above.

                              5. In the Name field, summarize the purpose for
                              which you will use these credentials. This name is
                              for internal use only, so assign any name that you
                              will recognize.

                              6. In the OAuth Scopes section, select at least
                              the minimum scopes your app will require.

                              7. Select **Save** at the page’s lower right-hand
                              corner.


                              A successful save will display a pop-up containing
                              the API credentials that your app will need to run
                              authenticated requests – your Client ID and Access
                              Token. A .txt file containing the same credentials
                              will (on most browsers) automatically download to
                              your computer. This file also contains the base
                              API Path for your store, preconfigured for the v3
                              API.


                              The base api path will look something like this:


                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/123456/`

                              In the base path, the store hash is the 123456.
                              This will be used to make api requests.


                              From a security perspective, these credentials are
                              sensitive – please treat them with the same
                              caution that you would treat a private key or root
                              password


                              To get started making requests, see [API
                              Requests](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/making-requests).

                                Make sure you store your credentials before
                                dismissing the popup, either by copying/pasting
                                the contents of each field or by keeping the

                                to repeat all the above steps to generate new

                              To revoke an OAuth token, use the following steps
                              to delete the associated API account:

                              1. Log into the store, using the store owner’s
                              username/password.

                              2. Select **Advanced Settings**.

                              3. Select **API Accounts**. This will display the
                              Store API Accounts page, shown below.

                              4. In the Actions column at right, select the
                              trash-can button next to the account you want to
                              delete.

                              ## Getting Client ID and Client Secret


                              * The Client ID value uniquely identifies your
                              app. You will need to pass it in the header of all
                              your requests to the API.

                              * The Client Secret value is a secret that your
                              app and BigCommerce share. You only need to pass
                              the Client Secret value once, during the app
                              installation sequence. Thereafter, BigCommerce
                              uses it to sign payloads in load, uninstall, and
                              remove user requests, and your app uses it to
                              verify the signature to ensure that the request is
                              coming from BigCommerce.


                              To get a Client ID and Client Secret you will need
                              to log in to Dev Tools. Dev Tools can be accessed
                              by clicking **My Apps** in the top-right corner of
                              the Developer Portal.


                              1. Click **Create an app**  

                              2. Give your app a name. This will only be visible
                              to you

                              3. A pop up box will display showing Your Profile,

                              During the app installation process, your app will
                              use the Client Id and Client Secret to obtain an
                              Oauth token authorized against the store
                              installing the app. For a detailed look at this
                              process, see [Building an
                              App](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps).

                                As of July 31, 2018, new BigCommerce stores are
                                no longer able to create Legacy API Accounts
                                (accounts using HTTP Basic Auth) within their
                                control panels. Existing Legacy API Accounts
                                will continue to work until further notice, but
                                we strongly recommend migrating to OAuth as soon
                                as possible.
                          - type: text
                            data: "### Migrating to OAuth comes with several benefits:\n\n* All OAuth requests are sent to a common hostname: `https://api.bigcommerce.com`. Using a single hostname prevents any interruption of service when the domain or SSL on a particular store changes or expires.\n\n* All of BigCommerce’s newest V3 APIs are exclusively available via OAuth.\n\n* OAuth API accounts have access to subscribe to BigCommerce’s Webhooks for real-time event notifications\n\n* The ability to use new APIs that require a shared secret, such as the Storefront Login API or the Storefront Current Customer identification endpoint.\n\n* Gzip compression on API responses to reduce bandwidth usage\n\n* Better security as all OAuth tokens are scoped to particular endpoints\n\n### How to Migrate\n\nFirst, consider whether your application should reside within the public App Marketplace, where any BigCommerce merchant can quickly discover and install it. To learn more about how to set up this kind of app, see [Becoming a Partner](/api-docs/partner/becoming-a-partner).\n\nIf you would like to update your API connection from Basic Authentication to OAuth, you will need to make the following changes:\n\n- Get a Client ID and an Access Token, by creating an API Account within the control panel. You’ll want to make sure the account has the correct Scopes for the API endpoints you need to access. We recommend that you provide the minimum scopes that your application requires to function, as a good security practice.\n- If you use one of the Client Libraries, follow the relevant guide (within the library’s documentation) for establishing an OAuth connection.\n- If you have created your connection, you’ll want to update your connection parameters:\n\t- Where you previously used the BigCommerce store’s secure hostname, you will instead use the `https://api.bigcommerce.com` gateway URL.\nAs an example, requests to `https://store-abc123.mybigcommerce.com/api/v2/orders/123` or `https://my-custom-store-domain.com/api/v2/orders/123 `would instead go to `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v2/orders/123`.\n- With Basic Auth, you use an Authentication HTTP Header to authenticate your connection. With OAuth, you’ll want to use two headers:\n\t- X-Client-Id for your Client ID, and the \n\t- X-Auth-Token header for your Access Token. You can read more [here](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/authentication).\n\nRate limiting of API requests works differently for OAuth API connections. To become familiar with the OAuth system, please see the [Rate Limits](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/best-practices#best-practices_rate-limits)."

                              Scope limits ability to read or write to data. Set
                              the scope to the minimum level needed to
                              accomplish the task at hand.


                              All OAuth scopes except `default` have `read_only`
                              scopes that allow only `GET` and `HEAD` requests.


                              - Webhooks are accessible from the default scope
                              that is available when an API Credentials are
                              created.

                              A media type is the format of the request or
                              response body. The BigCommerce API accepts
                              requests and responds in JSON. You should encode
                              requests using the UTF-8 character set. (Other
                              character sets might have unpredictable results).

                              ### Request Content Type

                              When performing a request that contains a body
                              (eg. POST or PUT), the type of content you are
                              sending needs to be specified in the Content-Type
                              header. 


                              ### Response Content Type

                              There are two ways you can specify the type of
                              content you would like to receive. The first
                              method is to specify an Accept header. The second
                              is to supply an extension to the resource you are
                              requesting. 


                              The priority in which these methods are processed

                              ## Request and Response Structure


                              ### Request Structure

                              The body of a JSON request is an object containing
                              a set of key-value pairs. A simple representation
                              of a product object is:


                              ```

                              {
                                   "id": 5,
                                   "name": "iPod",
                                   "description": "A portable MP3 music player."
                               } 
                              ```


                              ### Response Structure

                              Responses are structured similarly to requests. If
                              a request returns a single object, then the
                              response will contain a single object, containing
                              the fields for that resource.

                              To filter collections down to a particular set of
                              items, you can add filters to your request as URL
                              query parameters.


                              250 products is the maximum number of products
                              that be returned. To view more than that, a script
                              is needed to loop through each page.


                              These are the most common filter options available
                              for the V3 API: 


                              | Operator | Expression  | Example | 

                              |--|--|--|

                              `/v3/catalog/products?name=My Product` |

                              | Greater than or equal to (for numbers or dates)
                              | attribute:min=value  |
                              `/v3/catalog/products?price:min=10` |

                              Available filters vary by endpoint. Refer to the
                              GET method for an endpoint to see a list of
                              available filters.



                              ### Includes


                              Some endpoints allow an `?include` parameter to
                              include subresources and other information in the
                              primary GET response for a parent object.


                              This allows you to save API calls by getting more
                              information in a response. However, it may slow
                              down your response.


                              As an example, you can include a product's
                              variants and images with the product response:
                              `/v3/catalog/products?include=variants,images`


                              Availability of the `?include` parameter varies by
                              endpoint. Refer to the GET method for an endpoint
                              to see a list of fields that can be included.


                              ### Including and Excluding fields


                              Some endpoints support both `?include_fields` and
                              `?exclude_fields`. 


                              `include_fields` will return ONLY the specified
                              fields in the response. `exclude_fields` will omit
                              the specified fields from the response.


                              You can specify any field that is available on the
                              object. Excluding fields you don't care about
                              (especially large fields like descriptions) can
                              speed up your API request response time.



                              #### Example


                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products?include_fields=name,price`


                              Here, product name and price have been included:


                              ```

                              {
                                  "data": [
                                      {
                                          "id": 77,
                                          "name": "Red printed scarf",
                                          "price": 12
                                      }    
                                  ]
                              }    

                              ```


                              ### Pagination and Limit


                              `?page` is the number of pages that are returned
                              via api. 

                              `?limit` is the number of results per page that
                              are returned.


                              ###

                              `page=2&limit=10`

                              This will return page 2 of the results with 10
                              items per page.

                              BigCommerce frequently enhances its core product
                              and is actively developing v3 API endpoints. By
                              using the newest API version, you will ensure that
                              your app has access to the latest resources. You
                              will also be better positioned to provide a user
                              experience consistent with what merchants will see
                              in their BigCommerce store’s control panel. To
                              stay up to date, bookmark our

                              application


                              To keep data in your application up-to-date,
                              [webhooks](/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/about-webhooks)
                              provide a great alternative to doing periodic
                              checks. In order to register a webhook event that
                              your application can listen for, you will need to
                              use OAuth (not legacy “Basic Authentication”).


                              BigCommerce will send a partial payload when a
                              subscribed event is triggered, with minimal
                              identifying details (such as the order ID when an
                              order is created). Your application could use the
                              order ID returned in the payload to make a
                              subsequent API request for the full order details.

                              In order to quickly update information in the API,
                              you can use threaded requests. Threaded requests
                              allow you to send multiple requests at one time.
                              They can come from a different open connection or
                              multiple requests to the same resource. 


                              The [BigCommerce Ruby
                              API](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-api-ruby)
                              client is thread-safe: It satisfies the need for
                              multiple threads to access the same shared data
                              and the need for a shared piece of data to be
                              accessed by only one thread at any given time.
                              These attributes can reduce the total time that
                              your app will require to complete a series of
                              requests.
                            header:

                              ## Marketplace Apps


                              Merchants often have more than one person working
                              on their store. BigCommerce allows additional
                              users to access your app when the store owner has
                              granted them appropriate permissions. The
                              requirements for supporting multi-user access are:

                              * Tokens must be stored against the store_hash and
                              not against user info.

                              * Within the Dev Tools workspace, you must enable
                              your app’s Technical > Multiple Users option.


                              In the payload returned when a user launches an
                              app, users are distinguished by `owner_email`
                              versus `user_email`. If these two emails match,
                              the user is the store owner.


                              If you wish to enable user removal, you can do by
                              filling in your app’s Technical > Remove User
                              Callback URL field in Dev Tools. (Enabling user
                              removal is optional).

                              For more advanced implementations, you can enable
                              the store owner to grant specific permissions to
                              different non-admin users. For example,
                              person1@email.com could be restricted to editing
                              product inventory but not seeing orders. If you
                              decide to include this feature in your app, it’s a
                              great feature to advertise.

                              ## API Rate Limits

                              Apps that authenticate with OAuth are
                              rate-limited, based on a quota that is refreshed
                              every few seconds. The maximum quota for a store
                              will vary depending on the store’s plan.


                              * Enterprise plans and Enterprise Sandboxes
                              (Enterprise-Test): Unlimited (7mil / 30sec)

                              * Pro plans: 80k per hour (450 / 30sec)

                              * All other sandboxes (Dev/Partner/Employee): 20k
                              per hour (150 / 30sec)

                              * Plus & Standard plans: 20k per hour (150 /
                              30sec)


                              Each request to the API consumes one available
                              request from the quota. When an app hits the quota
                              limit, subsequent requests are rejected until the
                              quota is refreshed.


                              The store’s overall quota is distributed across
                              all apps that are accessing the store at a given
                              time. This provides fairness for multiple apps
                              that are accessing the API simultaneously,
                              preventing a single greedy app from consuming the
                              store’s entire quota by itself. The quota might
                              adjust as additional clients connect or disconnect
                              while you’re running requests.

                              this request, the API quota will be refreshed. |

                              case, you would expect to be able to make 6 more
                              requests in the next 3000 milliseconds; on the 7th
                              request within 3000 milliseconds, you would be
                              rate limited and would receive an HTTP 429
                              response.|


                              If your request to the API triggers a [429 Too

                              response, then you know you’ve been limited.


                              The rate limited response will contain the
                              `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header, specifying a
                              time (in milliseconds) that your client must wait
                              before its quota has refreshed. Retry the request
                              after this time has elapsed, and your API service
                              will resume as normal.

                              ### Making Requests in Parallel

                              You might wish to increase the amount of work your
                              application can do in a given unit of time, by
                              sending multiple HTTP requests to the BigCommerce
                              API in parallel. This is perfectly acceptable.

                              However, your application should monitor the rate
                              limiting headers to avoid an HTTP 429 response.
                              Methods for doing this might include:

                              * Slowing your rate of API requests when
                              X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left is nearing zero.

                              * Determining an acceptable average rate of
                              requests, by dividing X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota
                              by X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Seconds, and then
                              self-throttling to that rate.

                              BigCommerce does have limits on the number of
                              products, categories, brands, etc. that can be
                              created in a store. See [Platform

Either credentials are absent from the request, or we are receiving invalid credentials. Steps to resolve this:\n\t* Double-check your Access Token and Client ID.\n\t* If your credentials are valid, try sending a cURL request with the same credentials. This will test whether the problem is something within your application, rather than a credentials issue.\n* For 403 errors , there are 4 common causes:\n\t* Your app lacks the appropriate scopes to make the request that it sent. Resolution: Check the OAuth scopes that you requested, either in control panel > API Accounts or in Developer Portal’s My Apps section.\n\t* The store-owner account has changed on a store that installed your app. Resolution: This might require a reinstall by the new store owner, or a rollback of the store-owner changes.\n\t* Your API request exceeded an enforced platform limit. Among other limits, each store is limited to a maximum of 30,000 brands and 16,000 categories. For more information about these limits, see either the API resource you are using or our support documentation on platform limits.\n\t* Check your URL paths. An incorrect path can sometimes trigger a 403 error.\n* 500 errors almost always indicate an internal server error on BigCommerce’s side. Steps to resolve these:\n\t* Re-attempt the request three to five times, with increasing delays of at least a minute between attempts.\n\t* Check our status page.\n\t* 500 errors can also be caused by particularly expensive API calls. To avoid these errors on stores with very complex data, try reducing how many objects you are requesting. In the v2 API, you can request fewer objects by using ?limit={count}. In either the v2 or v3 API, you can request fewer objects by excluding certain fields or only requesting certain fields.\n\t\n### Why am I getting an HTTP 204 or 301/302 response to an API request?\n* Double-check the URL to which you are making an API request. If the response code is 301/302, try the WWW or non-WWW version of the URL."

                              Single-click apps are listed in our App
                              Marketplace, making them available for
                              installation on all BigCommerce stores. The
                              “single-click” app flow does not mean users
                              install the app in a single click, but rather, the
                              app does not require the customer to install OAuth
                              credentials themselves or configure any settings
                              for a third party service. 


                              To put an app on the Marketplace, you must first
                              be a BigCommerce partner and have your app
                              approved through the App Submission Process. After
                              becoming a partner and having the app approved you
                              have the option of charging merchants to use the
                              app. 


                              Single-click apps use the Client ID and Client
                              Secret obtained from the Dev Tools workspace to
                              request an OAuth token during the [single-click
                              app authentication

                              ## Private Apps


                              In some cases, you might want to create an API
                              Account in your store’s control panel as the
                              fastest way to establish an API connection to an
                              individual store and to start running requests. 


                              Use Cases:

                              - You are not creating an application for
                              distribution in the BigCommerce App Marketplace.

                              - You are testing your app before submission, and
                              it doesn’t need to be distributed to other stores.


                              Private Apps can request an Oauth token
                              programmatically using the Client ID and Client
                              Secret from [Dev
                              Tools](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com), or you
                              can authenticate using an OAuth token from the
                              store’s [control

                              Approved partners have the option of uploading
                              “hidden” apps to the App Marketplace. A hidden app
                              is a published app that does not show up in the
                              public BigCommerce marketplace. To create a hidden
                              app you need to be a BigCommerce Partner. 


                              Use Cases:

                              - A partner is beta-testing an integration before
                              a full Marketplace launch.

                              - A BigCommerce user with several stores wants to
                              install a custom app on all of them. Submitting a
                              hidden app offers a streamlined alternative to
                              creating a separate draft or test apps for each
                              store.

                              To have an app hidden, please contact <a

                              You can write a script to test an endpoint, check
                              small portions of app code you are writing, or to
                              create an application that will not be distributed
                              in the BigCommerce Marketplace. Scripts do not
                              have a user interface. 


                              To get started with writing scripts all you need
                              are API Credentials from the store’s Control

                              App Marketplace as “Connector” apps. These apps
                              use manual OAuth token creation instead of the
                              single-click app flow.


                              While we always recommend and prefer the
                              single-click app flow’s programmatic OAuth
                              exchange, certain use cases might not be
                              compatible.


                              Use Cases:

                              - Customized integrations that vary per store.

                              - Integrations that do not provide any content for
                              an iframe.

                              - Apps that do not provide Web services for OAuth
                              exchange. (For example: offline sync apps.)

                              - Apps that do not provide Web or cloud-hosted
                              components for a dashboard.

                                pass those values into the app manually. The
                                single-click installation process is preferred
                                since it does not require this step.

                              To create a connector app that uses manual OAuth
                              token creation, make the following selections on
                              the Technical tab when registering your app in Dev
                              Tools: 


                              1. Set the App Type option to Connector.

                              2. Enter your app’s Signup URL. This is the URL
                              where a user would begin to configure the
                              connection between your service and the
                              BigCommerce store.

                              4. Under OAuth scopes, select the scopes that your
                              app requires for BigCommerce review only. Later,
                              you will need to instruct store users to create a
                              token with the production scopes your app needs.


                              BigCommerce must review and approve your connector
                              app proposal before we will accept the app’s
                              submission to the Marketplace. 


                              If you’re interested in submitting your
                              integration as a connector app, please contact out
                              to <a

                              ## OAuth Summary


                              API token creation is a permission reserved for
                              the [store
                              owner](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-API-Accounts#creating)
                              user account. An app can request authentication
                              “on behalf” of a store owner, allowing the app to
                              make API requests against store data.


                              To test an app before release, apply for a
                              [sandbox](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/)
                              store.
                               
                              - When a merchant clicks your app's Install button
                              in the control panel, a [/GET
                              request](#building-apps_recieving-get-request) is
                              sent to your app's [Auth callback
                              URL](#building-apps_recieving-get-request). 

                              - The /GET request sent from BigCommerce contains
                              a `code` or temporary access token, `client_id`,
                              `client_secret`, `scopes` and [other
                              information](##building-apps_recieving-get-request).
                              Your Auth Callback URL needs to be served over
                              https. You should also have access to your app's
                              server logs which will allow you to see the
                              information in the request.

                              - Your app needs to
                              [respond](#building-apps_responding-get-request)
                              to the /GET  with HTML that will be rendered in an
                              iframe in the store's control panel.

                              - Your app then needs to make a /POST request back
                              to BigCommerce that contains the code, client_id
                              and client secret. This should be done
                              programmatically. 

                              - BigCommerce will respond with a permanent Oauth
                              token authorized against the store that has
                              installed your app.

                              - After installation, the store_hash and
                              access_token should be stored somewhere secure so
                              the app does not lose its authorization. 



                              ### FAQ's

                              **How can I make API calls?**   

                              We have built several [Hello
                              World](/tools-resources) apps to get you started
                              quickly. You can use these apps as a starting
                              point or an example for building a Single-click
                              app. 


                              If you'd like to make test API requests without
                              the overhead of installing a draft app, you can
                              generate [API
                              Credentials](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/authentication#authentication_getting-api-credentials)
                              by creating an API Account in your store's control
                              panel.


                              **How can I sell my app?**  

                              The first step to listing an app in the
                              BigCommerce App Marketplace is to apply to the
                              BigCommerce [partner
                              program](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/). 


                              For more details on including your app in the
                              Marketplace, see [App Store Approval
                              Requirements](/api-docs/partner/app-store-approval-requirements).

                              API requests are authenticated by the following
                              HTTP headers:


                              ```

                              X-Auth-Client: The Client ID of the requesting
                              app. 

                              X-Auth-Token: Access token authorizing an app to
                              access store data on behalf of a user

                              ```


                              In addition, while not all resources require the
                              Accept and Content-Type headers, many do. To
                              ensure that your calls succeed, always include
                              these headers. For more details on request headers
                              and their accepted values, see [Request
                              Headers](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/api-environment#api-environment_request-headers).

                              ## Managing Users Session Timeouts


                              We recommend that you add BigCommerce’s JavaScript
                              SDK to your Single-Click Apps, to protect your
                              apps’ users from getting logged out of the
                              BigCommerce control panel after a period of
                              idleness. To include our SDK, add this script tag
                              to your Single-Click App:

                              `<script
                              src="//cdn.bigcommerce.com/jssdk/bc-sdk.js">`



                              Optionally, you can pass a logout callback
                              function within the initialization call:


                              ```

                              Bigcommerce.init({
                                    onLogout: callback
                              });

                              ```



                              This callback function will run when the user
                              explicitly logs out of the BigCommerce control
                              panel, or is automatically logged out. The
                              callback will allow your app to respond to this
                              logout appropriately.
                            header:

                              ## App Installation and Update Sequence


                              The purpose of the App Installation sequence is to
                              obtain an Oauth token for the store installing the
                              app, using the Client ID and Secret from Dev
                              Tools. 


                              A user kicks off the installation or update
                              sequence from within a store's control panel by
                              clicking the “Install” button from your app
                              details page, or by clicking an installed app to
                              update its scopes. BigCommerce redirects the user
                              to the Auth Callback URI provided during app
                              registration. The Auth Callback URI must be
                              publicly available, fully qualified, and served
                              over TLS.

                              The request comes from the client browser, rather
                              than directly from BigCommerce. This allows you to
                              use a non-publicly-available Auth Callback URI
                              while testing your app.


                              For security, Auth and Load callbacks should be
                              handled server-side. If you are building a
                              client-side application (such as an AngularJS
                              Single Page App), you should handle Auth and Load
                              callbacks outside that application. Use a separate
                              service that accepts the Auth and Load callback
                              requests, generates tokens, validates requests,
                              and then redirects the user to your client-side
                              app’s entry point.

                            data: '---'

                              ## Receiving the GET Request


                              The GET request to your Auth Callback URI contains
                              a temporary code that you can exchange for a
                              permanent OAuth token. It also includes a unique
                              value that identifies the store installing or
                              updating your app, as well as authorized scopes.


                              The following table details the full list of
                              parameters and values included in the GET request
                              from BigCommerce to your Auth Callback URI.
                              BigCommerce passes these within the URI itself as
                              query parameters.


                              | Parameter | Description |

                              | --- | --- |

                              | code | Temporary code to exchange for a
                              permanent OAuth token. See [Making the POST
                              request](#building-apps_making-post-request) below
                              for more information about this exchange. |

                              | scope | List of scopes authorized by the user.
                              As a best practice, your app should validate this
                              list to ensure that it matches the app&#39;s
                              needs, and fail if it does not. However, at this
                              time, the user does not have any opportunity to
                              pick and choose between scopes. The dialog
                              presented to the user requires the user to approve
                              all scopes or none. |

                              | context | The store hash: a unique value that
                              identifies the store on which a logged-in user has
                              clicked to install or your app. BigCommerce passes
                              this along with a context path, as follows:
                              `stores/{store_hash}`. Save the store hash value,
                              because you will need to pass it in all your
                              requests to the API. |


                              ### Example – Initial Installation


                              This example initiates the token exchange, with a
                              requested scope of store_v2_orders:


                              ```

                              GET
                              /auth?code=qr6h3thvbvag2ffq&scope=store_v2_orders&context=stores/g5cd38
                              HTTP/1.1  

                              Host: app.example.com

                              ```



                              ### Example – Updating Scopes

                              The following example requests a scope of
                              store_v2_products, in addition to the initially
                              requested scope of store_v2_orders:


                              ```

                              GET
                              /auth?code=qr6h3thvbvag2ffq&scope=store_v2_orders+store_v2_products&context=stores/g5cd38
                              HTTP/1.1  

                              Host: app.example.com

                              ```
                            header:
                              anchor: building-apps_recieving-get-request
                          - type: callout
                            data:
                              body: >-
                                Note that when your app receives a new token,
                                any previously issued token is invalidated.
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## Responding to the GET Request


                              Upon receiving the GET request at your Auth
                              Callback URI, your app should return some HTML to
                              the merchant browser. BigCommerce renders this in
                              an iframe inside of the control panel. It could be
                              a form that collects further information from the
                              user, or you could redirect the user to your app’s
                              main page. If you do not pass back some HTML, the
                              user will be left looking at a blank screen. Such
                              an app would not be accepted into the App
                              Marketplace.
                            header:
                              anchor: building-apps_responding-get-request
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## Making the POST Request


                              The POST request’s primary purpose is to exchange
                              the temporary access code for a permanent OAuth
                              token. However, your app must pass a number of
                              additional values to accomplish the exchange. Pass
                              the parameters and their values inside the request
                              body, using query parameters and URL-encoding. To
                              achieve this, you must include one of the
                              following HTTP headers:


                              `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
                              or `Content-Type: application/json`


                              Make the POST request to the following address:
                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/oauth2/token`


                              ### Initial Installation


                              During initial installation, upon receiving the
                              POST, BigCommerce marks the status of your app as
                              “Installed”, removes the progress-indicator
                              overlay, and places your app icon in the control
                              panel’s left-hand navigation. With the
                              progress-indicator overlay removed, the user can
                              interact with the HTML that you returned in your
                              GET response.
                            header:

                              body: >-
                                During app updates, upon receiving the POST,
                                BigCommerce removes the update prompt from the
                                control panel.

                              should also store the user and store hash values,
                              to identify the user and store at load and
                              uninstall. The following sections detail the

This causes BigCommerce to send a GET request to the Load Callback URI that you provided during app registration. In a production environment, the Load Callback URI must be publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL.\n\n```\nThe GET request contains a signed payload, as shown below.\nGET /load?signed_payload=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1\nHost: app.example.com\n```\n\nUpon receiving a GET request to the Load Callback URI, your app needs to [process the signed payload](#building-apps_processing-signed-payload). After processing the payload, your app returns its user interface as HTML. BigCommerce renders this inside of an iframe. Please see [User Interface Constraints](#building-apps_user-interface-constraints) for important information about your app’s user interface.\n\n### Uninstall Request (Optional)\n\nStore owners have the option to uninstall any app at any time. When a store owner uninstalls an app, the app’s OAuth token is revoked and the app cannot make requests to the Stores API on the store’s behalf anymore.\n\nYou do not need to provide an Uninstall Callback URI. The lack of an Uninstall Callback URI does not prevent uninstallation. Instead, the Uninstall Callback URI allows you to track store owners who uninstall your app and to run cleanup operations, such as removing the store’s user accounts from your system.\n\nShould you choose to avail of this option and provide an Uninstall Callback URI, please note that it must be publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL. If provided, BigCommerce will send a GET request to your Uninstall Callback URI when a store owner clicks to uninstall your app.\n\nExample of a GET Request sent to the Uninstall Callback URI\n```\nGET /uninstall?signed_payload=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1\n\tHost: app.example.com\n```\nUpon receiving the GET request, your app will need to process the signed payload."

                              enable multi-user support, you can optionally
                              specify a Remove User Callback URI. It must be

                              over TLS/SSL. BigCommerce will send a GETrequest
                              to your Remove User Callback URI when a store
                              admin revokes a user’s access to your app.

                              Processing the signed payload involves splitting
                              and decoding it, verifying the HMAC signature, and
                              processing the JSON object.


                              ### Splitting and Decoding the Signed Payload


                              The signed payload is a string containing a base64
                              url-encoded JSON string and a base64 url-encoded
                              HMAC signature. The parts are delimited by the `.`
                              character:


                              ```

                              encoded_json_string.encoded_hmac_signature

                              ```



                              To decode the signed payload, complete the
                              following steps:

                              1. Split signed_payload into its two parts at the
                              `.` delimiter.

                              2. Decode encoded_json_string using base64url.

                              3. Convert the decoded JSON string into an object.
                              See Processing the JSON object for more about this
                              object.

                              4. Decode encoded_hmac_signature using base64url.

                              5. Use your client secret to verify the signature.
                              See the next section for more details.


                              ### Verifying the HMAC Signature


                              To verify the payload, you need to sign the
                              payload using your client secret, and confirm that
                              it matches the signature that was sent in the
                              request.

                              ### Processing the JSON Object


                              The JSON object embedded in the signed_payload
                              contains information about the BigCommerce store
                              and the store owner or user.


                              ### Identifying the Store

                              You should use the store information endpoint to
                              identify the store to which the request pertains.


                              ### Interpreting the User Information


                              Interpreting the user information varies as
                              follows:


                              | Request type | Multiple users enabled | Multiple
                              users not enabled |

                              | --- | --- | --- |

                              | Load | Compare the user information to see if it
                              matches that of the store owner, received at the
                              time of [app
                              installation](#building-apps_installation-update-sequence)
                              or that of an existing user. If the user
                              information does not match either of these, then
                              it represents a new user that you should add to
                              your database or other storage. | The information
                              should match that of the store owner, received at
                              the time of [app
                              installation](#building-apps_installation-update-sequence).
                              |

                              | Uninstall | The user information should match
                              that of the store owner. Only the store owner can
                              uninstall your app. | Should match the store
                              owner. |

                              | Remove user | The user information should match
                              one of the users that you have stored. After
                              locating the stored user, delete it from your
                              database or other storage. | N/A |


                              ### JSON Values


                              | Name | Data Type | Value Description |

                              | --- | --- | --- |

                              | user.id | integer | Unique identifier for the
                              user who initiated the callback. |

                              | user.email | string | Email address of the user
                              who initiated the callback. |

                              | owner.id | integer | Unique identifier for the
                              user listed as the store owner. |

                              | owner.email | string | Email address of the user
                              listed as the store owner. |

                              | context | string | The context value is part of
                              the API path for this store and includes the
                              store_hash. |

                              | store_hash | string |Unique identifier for the
                              store. |

                              ## Multi-User Support


                              When you register your app with BigCommerce,
                              enabling multi-user support will allow store
                              admins to manually authorize users – other than
                              the store owner – to load the app. 


                              As soon as you enable multi-user support, the
                              control panel of any store that has your app
                              installed will be affected. If you already have an
                              app published in the App Marketplace, be aware
                              that this setting takes effect immediately.
                              Therefore, we recommend testing your multi-user
                              support using a separate app that is in draft
                              status.


                              Let your customers know that you’ve enabled this
                              feature. Otherwise, they won’t know that they can
                              start granting access to users.


                              If multi-user support is added after your app has
                              launched, the update will cause the app scopes to
                              change and users will be alerted of the new
                              permission request.


                              ### The Control Panel Experience

                              Store admins will be able to adjust user
                              permissions to grant/deny other store users’
                              access to your app. The next time the user logs
                              in, they will see any apps for which they have
                              been granted access. The user can then click on
                              the app icon in the left navigation to load it.

                              Use your draft app and your sandbox store to
                              review this behavior.


                              ### The Load Request

                              Apps that support multiple users can expect the
                              email and ID of the user that initiated the
                              callback in addition to the owner’s email and ID
                              in the JSON object sent in the load request. If a
                              load request is sent with information for a user
                              you haven’t seen yet, you should provision the
                              user account and associate it with the store in
                              your database.


                              Because you know the store owner’s email and ID
                              from the App Installation sequence, your app can
                              distinguish store owners from other users. This
                              allows you to provide different user experiences
                              based on the information in the load request. Here
                              is a summary of the two types of users:


                              - Store owner: Can install, uninstall, and load
                              apps.

                              - Users: Cannot install or uninstall apps.
                              Permitted only to load the apps that a store admin
                              has authorized.


                              For further details, please see [Load Request and
                              Response](#building-apps_load-uninstall-removal-requests).


                              ### The Remove User Request

                              In addition to their ability to add users, store
                              admins can also remove users. This action
                              generates a GET request to the Remove User
                              Callback URI that you provided in My Apps. Your
                              app should delete from its records the user
                              identified in the request.


                              For further information, please see [Remove User

                              ## External App Installation


                              Apps can be installed from outside the BigCommerce
                              control panel. For example, you could create an
                              install link on your company’s site that directs
                              the merchant to download your app. This section
                              provides a step-by-step guide.


                              ### Create an Install Button


                              First, embed an install button like the one below,
                              at any Web location from which you’d like to
                              enable app installation:
                          - type: image
                            data: >-
                              //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6490/1539297285625
                          - type: text
                            data: >+
                              Redirect anyone who presses your button to:
                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/<your-app's-client-id>/install`

                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ### Configure Your Button

                              Upon click, your button should open a modal
                              similar to the image below. We recommend a modal
                              sized 900px wide by 450px high:
                          - type: image
                            data: >-
                              //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6490/1539297431440
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              Your button will link merchants to BigCommerce’s
                              install endpoint for your application. Once the
                              merchant clicks the link, they will be prompted to
                              log in, then authorize your application, just like
                              in the [normal installation
                              flow](#building-apps_installation-update-sequence).

                            data: >-
                              ### Render Success/Failure Pages


                              Modify your application code to serve either a
                              success or failure page, depending on whether the
                              external installation was successful or
                              unsuccessful.


                              If you skip this step, your application will load
                              in the iframe created by your button. To ensure a
                              good experience for your merchants, we strongly
                              recommend that you return a confirmation page,
                              instead of allowing your application to be loaded
                              in that modal.


                              ### Handling Errors


                              If your application’s installation was initiated
                              and completed through an external link,
                              BigCommerce will send your auth callback endpoint
                              an extra parameter called external_install.

                              If you receive this parameter and there are no
                              errors, call:


                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/<your_app_client_id>/install/succeeded`


                              If there were errors, call:

                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/<your_app_client_id>/install/failed`


                              Below is a sample code snippet of an auth callback
                              that does this:
                            header:
                              anchor: building-apps_external-app-installation
                          - type: code
                            data: |2-
                                 if params['external_install']
                                      return get 'https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/m8e1mkkmjw2xjinydqz7ie05to1y2nk/install/succeeded'
                                  end

                                  redirect '/'

                              rescue => e
                                  if params['external_install']
                                      return get 'https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/m8e1mkkmjw2xjinydqz7ie05to1y2nk/install/failed'
                                  end
                            header:
                              title: Auth Callback
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              Depending on which endpoint you call, we will
                              render one of the following success/failed pages
                              to the modal.
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## User Interface Constraints


                              Single-click apps benefit from a high level of
                              integration with the BigCommerce platform. Users
                              interacting with your app will enjoy a seamless
                              experience. BigCommerce achieves this by rendering
                              your app&#39;s user interface inside of an iframe
                              within the control panel. To ensure acceptance
                              into the App Marketplace, your app should be able
                              to perform all of its functions inside of the
                              iframe.


                              While very usable and friendly, the iframe
                              approach does require special attention from app
                              developers. The remainder of this page discusses
                              several functional areas to consider when
                              designing and developing your app.


                              ### About Mixed Content


                              The BigCommerce control panel is served over
                              TLS/SSL. Your app must be hosted on a web server
                              that accepts and sends TLS/SSL requests. In
                              addition, all of the resources referenced in the
                              HTML that you present to the end users must be
                              served over TLS/SSL. You may find
                              protocol-agnostic addressing helpful.


                              If the user interface retrieves images, scripts,
                              or other assets over a connection not encrypted
                              with TLS/SSL, the user will experience errors and
                              possibly an inability to interact with your app.
                              Before submitting your app, use an <a
                              href="https://www.jitbit.com/sslcheck/"
                              target="_blank">online crawler</a> to check for
                              insecure content.


                              ### About Same-Origin Policies


                              <a
                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy"
                              target="_blank">Same-origin policies</a> restrict
                              apps running within iframes from performing
                              certain activities, such as interacting with other
                              services and making OAuth connections. While apps
                              that operate within the BigCommerce iframe get
                              strong preference during App Marketplace
                              considerations, we sometimes make exceptions for
                              apps that need to interact with, and authenticate
                              to, other services. If your app requires this, we
                              advise you to open a new tab for actions that
                              cannot occur within the iframe.


                              ### About P3P and Cookies


                              Internet Explorer is one of the browsers that
                              BigCommerce [supports](#supported-browsers), and
                              our merchants do use it to access the control
                              panel. If your app needs to set a cookie, you will
                              need to craft a <a
                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P"
                              target="_blank">P3P policy</a>. Otherwise, your
                              app will experience issues on Internet Explorer.

                              Webhooks allow app developers to be notified, in
                              near real-time, when specific events occur on a
                              BigCommerce store. For example, your app may need
                              to perform an action when a new order is created,
                              a product’s inventory decreases, or an item is
                              added to a shopper’s cart. When a subscribed event
                              occurs on a store, BigCommerce will POST a payload
                              to your app’s callback URI so your app can take
                              some action based on that event.

                                when the merchant imports 2,000 products, we
                                will send 2,000 individual callback events.

                              ## Authentication


                              Webhooks are authenticated using Oauth and support
                              the JSON media type. Basic auth and XML are not
                              supported.


                              Before you  can begin to send and receive
                              requests, you must have the following:


                              * **A store:** You can get a sandbox store by
                              joining the Partner Program.

                              * **OAuth Client ID:** Obtained by creating an API
                              Account.

                              * **OAuth token:** Obtained by creating an API
                              Account.

                              * **Valid TLS/SSL configuration:** Verify your app
                              server’s setup at the following site:
                              [https://sslcheck.globalsign.com](https://sslcheck.globalsign.com)

                                * Hostname/DNS mismatch.

                                * Self-signed certificate.

                                * Intermediate certificates not loaded.

                              ## Lightweight Callback Payload


                              When a subscribed event occurs, we send a light
                              payload with only minimum details regarding the
                              event that’s been triggered. This gives you
                              maximum flexibility as to how you want to handle
                              the notification in your application. For
                              instance, if you subscribe to the
                              `store/order/statusUpdated` event, we’ll send you
                              the order ID when the status is updated. You might
                              want to handle the notification by fetching the
                              full order details via a request to the Orders
                              resource.


                              An example payload follows:

If you choose to include a headers object, BigCommerce will include the name-value pair(s) in the HTTP header of its POST requests to your callback URI at runtime. While this feature could be used for any purpose, one is to use it to set a secret authorization key and check it at runtime. This provides an additional level of assurance that the POST request came from BigCommerce instead of some other party, such as a malicious actor. (Optional) | string |\n|is_active | Value specifies whether a webhook is active or inactive. By default, new webhooks will be set to be inactive and will have a blank value. If you want to create a webhook that should be active initially, you can pass the following name-value pair: \"is_active\": true.

                              There is not a way to delete all webhooks on a
                              store. Run a GET request for the webhook id, then
                              send a request to the delete URI to remove each
                              one. It returns a 200 OK for the response with the
                              deleted hook. When requesting a list of hook, the
                              hook id is not available.


                              If webhooks are no longer being used, either
                              delete them or set `is_active:false`.

                              You’ll need to build an application and configure
                              your server to receive the callback we send when
                              events are triggered.

                              ## Respond to Webhook Callbacks


                              You’ll need to build an application and configure
                              your server to receive the callback we send when
                              events are triggered.


                              To acknowledge that you received the webhook
                              without issue, your server should return a 200
                              HTTP status code. Any other information you return
                              in the request headers or request body will be
                              ignored. Any response code outside the 200 range,
                              including 3_xx_ codes, will indicate to us that
                              you did not receive the webhook. When a webhook is
                              not received (for whatever reason), we will retry
                              the callback as described below.

                              ## Callback Retry Mechanism


                              The webhooks service will do its best to deliver
                              events to your callback URI. If your server
                              indicates that the webhook payload has not been
                              received, the dispatch service will take the
                              following actions:

                              If an app server responds to a webhook payload
                              with anything other than a 2_xx_ response, or
                              times out, the app will be blocked for 60 seconds.

                              Webhooks created during that 60-second block will
                              be queued up to send on the next scheduled retry
                              attempt after the block expires, so that webhooks
                              are not lost.


                              The webhook dispatcher will then attempt several
                              retries (at increasing intervals) until the
                              maximum retry limit is reached.


                              ### Retry Intervals


                              * 60 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 180 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 180 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 300 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 900 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 1800 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 3600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 7200 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 21600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 50400 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 86400 seconds (24 hours) after the most recent
                              failure


                              After the final retry attempt (cumulatively, 48
                              hours after the first delivery attempt), the
                              webhook will automatically be deactivated, and we
                              will send an email to the developer’s email
                              address registered on the subscribing app. You can
                              reactivate the webhook by setting the `is_active`
                              flag back to true via a `/PUT` request to the
                              hooks resource.

                              ## Webhook Security

                              To ensure that webhook payloads are secure against
                              activity by a malicious actor, we take a
                              three-pronged approach:


                              * Webhook payloads contain minimal information
                              about the store and event, for example the ID
                              identifying the order or cart. To access
                              potentially sensitive information on a store, a
                              malicious actor would need to be fully
                              authenticated against that store’s API in order to
                              request full details.

                              * Webhook payloads are sent over a TLS-encrypted
                              connection.

                              * For added security, you can include custom
                              headers in your webhook creation request, and
                              these headers will be sent in the payload when an
                              event you subscribe to occurs. If your app
                              endpoint is secured by basic authentication, you
                              could set your own basic auth headers to
                              authenticate the payload at runtime.

                              ## Troubleshooting


                              ### Why am I not receiving event payloads to my
                              callback URI?

                              If your app does not return an HTTP 2_xx_ to
                              BigCommerce after receiving the webhook event
                              payload, BigCommerce considers it a failure.
                              BigCommerce will keep trying for a little over 48
                              hours. At the end of that time, BigCommerce sends
                              an email to the email address set during app
                              registration and disables the webhook by setting
                              the is_active flag to false.


                              You can proactively check to make sure that
                              everything is OK by periodically making a GET
                              request and checking the is_active flag.


                              If you receive an email or discover that the
                              is_active flag has been flipped to false, try the
                              following:


                              Check to see if your app is responding to the
                              event payload with something other than HTTP 200.

                              Check to make sure that your server has a valid
                              TLS/SSL setup. One way to do this is by visiting
                              the following website:
                              https://sslcheck.globalsign.com. Any of the
                              following will cause the TLS/SSL handshake to
                              fail:

                              Self-signed certificate.

                              Host name of the certificate does not match the
                              server’s DNS.

                              Your server’s key or trust store has not been
                              loaded up with the intermediate certificates
                              necessary to establish the chain of trust.

                              Once you have resolved the issue preventing the
                              connection, send a PUT request to flip the
                              is_active flag back to true. This will cause
                              BigCommerce to start sending the event payloads to
                              your callback URI again.


                              ### Why am I not receiving a 201 response after
                              creating a webhook?

                              After sending a POST request to create a webhook,
                              you should get an HTTP 201 back. If you do not,
                              check your TLS/SSL setup and be sure that your
                              request contains the following headers:


                              ```
                                   Accept: application/json
                                   Content-Type: application/json

                              As you are building your integration, you might
                              want to test webhooks on your local dev machines.


                              We suggest using ngrok, which you can use to
                              easily set up tunnels between a server running on
                              localhost and a public URL. This will enable you
                              to send our webhooks to your localhost
                              environments via a public URL. No production push
                              is required.

                              When testing your application locally, ngrok is a
                              helpful tool for viewing the webhook responses
                              that BigCommerce sends to your app. Ngrok creates
                              a publicly accessible tunnel URL to an application
                              running on your machine's localhost. Ngrok also
                              provides a web interface you can use to view HTTP
                              request details.


                              In this tutorial, we'll install ngrok, register a
                              webhook on your store, and then observe the
                              response when the webhook event is triggered.

                              1. Open the terminal and create a folder that will
                              hold ngrok and the Node app, then move into that
                              directory.


                              ```
                                  mkdir webhooks-test
                                  cd webhooks-test

                              project folder that you created.


                              This can be accomplished in one command:

                              unzip "file_to_unzip" -d  destination


                              `unzip
                              /Users/your-computer/Downloads/ngrok-stable-darwin-amd64.zip
                              -d /Users/your-computer/Documents/webhooks-test`


                              ### Windows


                              1. Visit https://ngrok.com/ and click download.

                              4. Make sure ngrok is referenced in your [PATH
                              environment
                              variable](https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them).

                              code snippet: 



                              ```
                                  const express = require('express')
                                  const app = express()
                                      app.post('/webhooks', function (req, res) {
                                      res.send('OK')
                                  })
                                  app.listen(3000, function () {

                              ```



                              The app is starting a server and listening on port
                              3000, then returning a response of ok once it
                              receives a POST to the /webhooks url.


                              ```

                              app.post('/webhooks', function (req, res) {
                               res.send('OK')

                              - app is an instance of express.

                              - METHOD is an [HTTP request
                              method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods),
                              in lowercase.

                              - PATH is a path on the server.

                              - HANDLER is the function executed when the route
                              is matched.

                              - Res.send is the body parameter that sends the

                              2. In one tab run the app. `node index.js`

                              3. In the other start ngrok. `./ngrok http 3000`

                              - **Web Interface:** Where you can monitor the
                              hook from a browser. `https://127.0.0.1:4040`

                              - **Forwarding:** The webhook destination. Make
                              note of the https version. For example,
                              `https://6a35e97b.ngrok.io`.


                              4. Open a web browser and copy in your Web
                              Interface URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4040`.  This is

                              1. Create a POST request using the try it now box
                              below or your API enviroment of choice to the
                              request

                              store's API path.

                              2. Create a request body where "scope" is the
                              webhook event we are subscribing to and
                              "destination" is your ngrok forwarding url with
                              /webhooks appended (the route specified in our

                              ```
                               

                              3. Update the request headers to contain:

                              ```
                                  Accept: application/json
                                  Content-Type: application/json
                                  X-Auth-Client: {{the OAuth client id}}
                                  X-Auth-Token: {{the OAuth token}}
                              ```

                              4. Check all the values and then hit POST. If
                              successful, the response will be 201 Created.

                              Webhooks can be triggered by actions performed by
                              a shopper on the storefront or user within the
                              control panel, or actions performed via API. To
                              illustrate this point, we'll demonstrate both
                              methods.


                              ### Update via the Control Panel


                              1. From your store’s control panel, navigate to
                              Products > View. Choose a product and edit product
                              details like name or description. 

                              2. Click **Save**.

                              with the text OK. The response is generated by
                              res.send(‘OK’) in our app code, but this text can
                              be changed to say something different or even post
                              the response to another app. For more info, see

                              webhook, set up a server to accept the response,
                              and used ngrok to observe the webhook payload.

                              `res.send()` to a custom response, print the
                              response to a webpage, or register a different

                                working. Send a DELETE request to the specific
                                webhook ID to disable the hook.

                              1. Getting a 404 error using the root (/) url?


                              Add this snippet to your code to respond to
                              incoming get requests with 'hello'.


                              ```

                              app.get('/',(req, res)=>{
                                  res.send('Hello!');
                              }); 

                              ```


                              2. Getting error ngrok not found?

                              There are two ways to fix this. Your local setup
                              will determine which command will work.

                              Use the command `mv ngrok /usr/local/bin `to move
                              ngrok to your local bin folder. This way it
                              becomes available globally. 

                              Use the command `./ngrok http 3000` to run ngrok
                              as a sudo user. 


                              3. Windows Users

                              If you are having trouble getting ngrok started
                              try setting the PATH.

                              when a change occurs to line items in the cart.
                              This can be items added to a cart, removed or
                              updated.(Ex. change to quantity, product options
                              or price). |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/created | When a new item is
                              added to the cart  |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/updated | When an item’s

                              change. |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/deleted | When an item is
                              deleted from the cart|

                              | store/cart/created | This webhook will fire
                              whenever a new cart is created either via a
                              storefront shopper adding their first item to the
                              cart or when a new cart being created via an API
                              consumer. If it is from the storefront, then it
                              fires when the first product is added to a new
                              session.(The cart did not exist before) For the
                              API it means a  `POST`  to /carts, (V3 and
                              Storefront API). The  `store/cart/updated`  will
                              also fire.|

                              | store/cart/updated | This webhook is fired
                              whenever a cart is modified through the changes in
                              its line items. Eg. when a new item is added to a
                              cart, an existing item’s quantity is updated, when
                              the email changes during guest checkout or an
                              existing item is deleted, the cart is modified
                              triggering this webhook. The payload will include
                              the ID of the cart being updated. <br> This
                              webhook is also fired along with cart created
                              because the first product being added to an empty
                              cart triggers an update. <br> - Logging into
                              customer account after creating a cart (email is
                              inherited from customer account email) <br>-
                              Entering email address via guest checkout <br>
                              -Changing the email in guest checkout |

                              | store/cart/deleted| This webhook will fire
                              whenever a cart is deleted. This is can be either
                              when all items have been removed from a cart and
                              it was auto-deleted or it was explicitly removed
                              via a DELETE request by an API consumer. This ends
                              the lifecycle of the cart. The 
                              `store/cart/updated`  webhook will also fire when
                              the last item is removed.|

                              | store/cart/couponApplied | This webhook will
                              fire whenever a new coupon code is applied to a
                              cart. It will include the ID of the coupon code |

                              | store/cart/abandoned | This webhook will fire
                              whenever a cart is considered abandoned. In the
                              BigCommerce store settings if enabled this is
                              usually set to one hour. [See Abandoned
                              Cart](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-the-Abandoned-Cart-Saver/).

                              | store/cart/converted | This hook fires when a
                              cart is converted into an order, which is
                              typically after the payment step of checkout on
                              the storefront. At this point, the Cart is no
                              longer accessible and has been deleted. This hook
                              returns both the Cart ID and Order ID for
                              correlation purposes. |

                        The following sections outline the steps required to
                        become a vendor of Single-Click Apps on the BigCommerce
                        platform. Doing so requires a partnership application,
                        but acceptance will authorize you to provide
                        best-of-breed solutions to the fast-growing online
                        businesses we host.


                        ## Apply to the Technology Partner Program


                        Before you can submit an app to the BigCommerce App
                        Marketplace (which merchants also know as our “app
                        store”), you must become an official Partner.
                        BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores
                        through its Technology Partner Program. To be approved
                        as a partner, you will need:


                        * A website

                        * Intent to offer your app publicly

                        * Ability to support users of your app

                        * Evidence of expertise in app development


                        Once approved, you will receive one or more emails
                        listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your
                        Partner ID will be required to submit your app for App
                        Marketplace consideration. If you do not receive these
                        credentials by email, please contact <a
                        href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.

                        ## Getting a Sandbox Store


                        To build a Marketplace app, you will need to have a
                        sandbox store, a developer account at
                        devtools.bigcommerce.com, and be accepted as a
                        BigCommerce partner. We encourage you to create your
                        sandbox store and your Dev Tools account using the same
                        login credentials. A sandbox store cannot process
                        transactions and is for developing and testing apps
                        without the 15-day time time limit of a trial store.

                        body: >-
                          A sandbox store is not required for app development,
                          but if you develop on a trial store instead, after 15
                          days the store will be erased along with the data and
                          a new store will need to be created. Applying to be a
                          partner and getting a sandbox store is best practice.

                        ### Create a Sandbox Store


                        1. Navigate to the [BigCommerce Pricing
                        page](https://www.bigcommerce.com/pricing/).

                        2. Select **START YOUR FREE TRIAL**.

                        3. Where prompted for an email address, enter the same
                        email that you used when applying to become a Technology
                        Partner. 

                        4. Select **CONTINUE TO STORE DETAILS**.

                        5. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name,
                        password, and other details. Then select **CREATE YOUR
                        STORE**.

                        6. Log in to the [Partner
                        Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com) and navigate
                        to Support > Create a Case > Issue Type = Portal and
                        Membership. In the case description, enter your new
                        sandbox store’s friendly URL (for example:
                        http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request
                        conversion to a Sandbox. We will flag this as a sandbox
                        store to ensure your continued access to the store, as
                        opposed to the normal 15-day trial. This can take around
                        two days.

                        7. When you log into your new store, use the same email
                        that you used for step 3 above.

                        ##  Troubleshooting


                        ### Are all fields required?


                        While not all fields are required to publish edits for
                        your listing, they are all highly recommended. Without
                        filling in all fields, your listing will be missing
                        information that merchants have seen on other listings
                        and expect to see throughout the Marketplace.


                        ###  I’ve logged in to Dev Tools, but I don’t see my
                        published listing. Where is it?


                        You may be logged in with the wrong account. Each
                        listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely
                        assigned to another email address. If you’re unable to
                        track down the correct owner account for your solution,
                        please reach out to <a
                        href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.


                        ### I saved my changes, but my listing detail page on
                        BigCommerce.com/Apps has not updated yet. What’s the
                        problem?


                        The changes will be effective immediately in your
                        control panel app card, but the updates can take up to
                        24 hours to appear on the public BigCommerce
                        Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to
                        make additional edits as needed.

                        Dev Tools is the BigCommerce workspace for developing
                        single-click apps. Within Dev Tools, you'll create the
                        Client Id and Client Secret to authenticate your apps,
                        submit new apps to the App Marketplace, and manage
                        existing Marketplace listings.


                        Dev Tools can be found by clicking [My

                        The requirements to submit an app are listed below, as
                        well as where the information needs to be updated.


                        ### Prerequisites


                        Make sure you’ve applied and been approved for our
                        [Technology Partner
                        Program](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx)
                        before you’re ready to submit your app - you’ll need a
                        valid Partner ID to do so. You’ll also need to accept
                        the Terms & Conditions in the [Partner
                        Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/)
                        before we can publish your app.


                        ### General Requirements


                        -   Support resources should be available throughout the
                        app experience, including in your onboarding flow and
                        the app’s dashboard.
                            
                        -   Make sure to reference BigCommerce using the proper
                        formatting. You can visit our [Media
                        Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/) for
                        any BigCommerce branding assets needed.
                            
                        -   The app and app listing should make no references to
                        competitor platforms.


                        -   Use the brand name you’ve given your app for your
                        app title throughout your app content. This listing name
                        should be a concise title for easy identification and
                        should not include additional taglines or descriptors.
                        The name will always appear alongside your summary, so
                        there’s no need to muddy your app’s branding with
                        duplicate content when that tagline is already displayed
                        with it!  
                              
                            - If your solution is a connector to a specific third-party service, or you’re offering only a specific feature, make sure to include both the name of the third party service or feature and your company name (Ex: “Marketplace by BigCommerce”, “Search by BigCommerce”), with your company name following the feature.
                            
                        -   Your app, including any storefront components,
                        should be compatible with all [browsers](#stencil-link)
                        that the BigCommerce platform supports.


                        ### Functionality


                        -   Your app must work as intended, be free of defects,
                        and not conflict with or break any default BigCommerce
                        functionality, including the BigCommerce storefront and
                        checkout.
                            
                        -   Utilize any V3 API resources that are currently
                        available for the data you need from a BigCommerce
                        store.
                            
                        -   The dashboard and callback URLs for your app should
                        operate strictly over HTTPS using a valid SSL
                        certificate.
                            
                        -   Apps should offer [multi-user
                        support](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#building-apps_multi-user-support)
                        so that permissions for the app can be distributed by
                        the store owner to additional users, from the
                        BigCommerce control panel.
                            
                        -   Any apps that process transactions or handle credit
                        card data will need to pass a PCI Compliance review with
                        our Security team, and also be compatible with our
                        Optimized One-Page Checkout.
                            
                        -   Avoid copy/paste for storefront code - use the [V3
                        Scripts API](/api-reference/content/content-scripts-api)
                        to programmatically inject code snippets into a store’s
                        Script Manager and storefront theme.
                            
                        -   If your app requires payment, you’ll need to collect
                        payment from the user within your app. More info on
                        [monetizing your app

                        ### Installation


                        -   Apps should be Single-Click and use our OAuth token
                        exchange flow to authenticate the user
                            
                        -   Single-Click does not mean everything  completed in
                        one click, but that authentication is handled in that
                        click - other tasks can be handled post-auth with the
                        user
                            
                        -   When the app is installed, a styled HTML page must
                        be returned in the iframe of the BigCommerce control
                        panel - this content cannot be blank and must follow our
                        [user-interface
                        constraints](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#building-apps_user-interface-constraints).
                            
                        -   During the OAuth handshake, be sure to store the
                        user’s token against their store hash - rather than
                        their email address - to avoid any problems with
                        ownership changes or multi-user support.

                        -   Have a form to fill out for new users? We recommend
                        auto-filling user input fields with data from the [Store
                        Information API
                        resource](/api-reference/store/store-information-api),
                        which already contains much of the info you might need
                        from a new user.
                            
                        -   No account approval process needed for your app?
                        Consider automatically generating accounts for stores
                        that install your app and don’t match an existing store
                        in your database.
                            
                        -   Require login on launch? Use the information in the
                        BigCommerce payload to your callback URL to authenticate
                        the user without asking for a username and password each
                        time.
                            
                        -   Want to share user testimonials? Add a link to your
                        full case study in the Case Studies field, with a title
                        and short description.

                                  applying for your Partner Id. 


                                  ### Partner Name

                                  List the name of your company​, as you want it
                                  to be attributed on the detail page.


                                  ### Partner Website

                                  Provide the URL for your homepage so users can
                                  learn more about your company.


                                  ### Support email

                                  Email where users can get help with the app.
                                  This should be a formal group email at your
                                  company domain (Ex: support@app-partner.com)
                                  rather than a personal email. If not provided,
                                  this option will not be displayed.


                                  ### Support website

                                  A Support email and website for users to reach
                                  out as needed.

                                  These will be publicly visible on the
                                  Marketplace, so make sure to stay away from
                                  personal emails or non-support URLs. Your
                                  public detail page will include a button for
                                  users to “Get Support,” which will take them
                                  to this URL in a new tab. If not provided, the
                                  button will not be displayed on your detail
                                  page.


                                  ### Partner ID

                                  When you’re ready to submit your listing for
                                  review, you will need to enter your [Partner
                                  ID](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx)
                                  for your Technology Partner account. This
                                  field is not required to create, save, or edit
                                  a Draft prior to submission.

                                  Use the brand name you’ve given your app for
                                  your app title throughout your app content.
                                  This listing name should be a concise title
                                  for easy identification and should not include
                                  additional taglines or descriptors. The name
                                  will always appear alongside your summary, so
                                  there’s no need to muddy your app’s branding
                                  with duplicate content when that tagline is
                                  already displayed with it.

                                  branding, no taglines necessary.

                                  app. Take a look at the live
                                  [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)
                                  for an idea of where solutions are currently
                                  assigned to help decide the right category.
                                  The category selection will also be a search
                                  attribute for your listing. BigCommerce will
                                  review your category assignment and may
                                  re-categorize your listing prior to launch.
                                  One category maximum.

                                  and why a merchant should choose you over

                                  #### Video Best Practices


                                  **YouTube**


                                  Turn off ads for any videos you've already
                                  uploaded. 


                                  1. Sign in to YouTube.


                                  2. In the top right, click your account icon >
                                  Creator Studio.


                                  3. On the left, select Video Manager.


                                  4. Select the video(s) where you want to turn
                                  ads off.


                                  5. Click Actions > More actions >
                                  Monetization.


                                  6. Select Off.


                                  7. Click Submit.


                                  **Vimeo**


                                  Per Vimeo’s guidelines, businesses may not use
                                  Basic or Plus accounts to host videos. If you
                                  want to upload commercial videos, you must use
                                  Vimeo PRO or Business. Commercial content
                                  includes:


                                  Videos promoting or representing a for-profit
                                  business or brand 

                                  Videos containing any form of advertising 

                                  Videos hosted on behalf of a business (i.e.,
                                  uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your
                                  company’s website) 

                                  Product demos and tutorials


                                  *Note:* Ads appear to viewers based on their
                                  level of Vimeo membership - not yours. Basic
                                  and non-logged in viewers may see ad banners
                                  below the video player.


                                  ### Case Studies

                                  These can either be “Thought Leadership” case
                                  studies and/or traditional case studies that
                                  demonstrate how BigCommerce merchants have
                                  benefited from using your solution with their
                                  business. Use the + ​icon to add a case study,
                                  and the x ​icon to remove. Four case studies
                                  maximum.

                                    repurpose general case studies, remove
                                    competitor platform mentions, and republish
                                    the asset accordingly.

                                  Use these fields to enumerate the major
                                  features your platform or solution has to
                                  offer. Include a brief title for each feature,
                                  and a description of the feature to accompany
                                  it. The feature title will be search indexed
                                  in the Marketplace, so be specific with your
                                  feature names and include major functions
                                  potential users will search for. Use the +
                                  icon to add a feature, and the x icon to
                                  remove. Utilize the rich text editing of these
                                  fields to bold, underline, or italicize copy
                                  as needed. 


                                  Up to five features can be added.

                                  Links to your User and Installation Guides as
                                  a reference for existing users and prospects.


                                  We now ask that you include links to your
                                  solution’s user installation guide (PDF,
                                  support articles, etc.) and standard user
                                  guide for prospective users to review before

                                  including these with your submission.

                                  when integrated with BigCommerce so users know
                                  what to expect.


                                  ### Alternate Logo

                                  Your alternate logo will be used if your app
                                  is featured on the homepage carousel of the
                                  Marketplace. This image should be 259 x 158px
                                  (or larger at this ratio) with a dark
                                  background and white or light branding in the
                                  foreground. The logo should only include
                                  branding, no taglines necessary.

                                  ### Multiple Users


                                  By default, your app will only be accessible
                                  to the store owner (i.e., the user who created
                                  the store). Optionally, you can allow your app
                                  to be accessible to other store users.
                                  Consider the following before enabling
                                  [multi-user
                                  support](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#multi-user-support):


                                  -   Once you enable multi-user support, a
                                  store admin will still need to grant access to
                                  other users from within the store control
                                  panel. For each user account, there are
                                  settings that grant access to specific apps.
                                      
                                  -   Your app should be aware that when it
                                  receives the [Load
                                  Callback](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests),
                                  the user information passed in might not be
                                  the store owner’s. You’ll need to determine
                                  how to respond if you see a different user.
                                  For example, you may want to provision a new
                                  user account in order to personalize the
                                  experience.
                                      
                                  -   You can optionally specify a [Remove User
                                  Callback
                                  URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests)
                                  to receive a callback when a store admin
                                  revokes a user’s access.
                                      
                                  ### App Type


                                  Select the type of app. We recommend [Single
                                  Click
                                  Apps](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/types-of-apps#single-click-apps)
                                  although some qualify to [Connector
                                  Apps.](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/types-of-apps#connector)


                                  ### Callback URLS


                                  You must have an [Auth Callback
                                  URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#installation-update-sequence)
                                  and a [Load Callback
                                  URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#installation-update-sequence)
                                  to register your app.


                                  #### Public URIs Required before Submission


                                  Because the Auth Callback URI and Load
                                  Callback URI requests originate from the
                                  browser and not from BigCommerce, you can use
                                  non–publicly-available URIs and a self-signed
                                  certificate for a quick start. However, you
                                  must switch to – and test your app with – a
                                  publicly available Auth Callback URI and Load
                                  Callback URI before submitting your app for
                                  consideration in the App Marketplace.


                                  If you want to receive a callback when the
                                  store owner uninstalls your app, you can
                                  provide an [Uninstall Callback
                                  URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests).

                                  If you know the [OAuth
                                  scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/authentication#oauth-scopes)
                                  that your app requires, you should select
                                  these. If you do not yet know the scopes that
                                  you need, you can just request minimal
                                  permissions (such as Information: Read-Only)
                                  to get started. However, once you determine
                                  the scopes you need, you must:

                                  - Modify the scopes of your app in My Apps and
                                  save the changes.

                                  - Obtain the new OAuth token during the [App
                                  Installation or Update
                                  flow](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/#app-installation-and-update-sequence).

                                  - Retest your app to make sure it still
                                  functions properly with the new token.

                              includes all the information about a product such
                              as MPN, warranty, price, and images.

                              Products are the primary catalog entity, and the
                              primary function of the e-commerce platform is to
                              sell products on the storefront and other selling
                              channels.


                              Products can either be
                              [Simple](#create-simple-product) or
                              [Complex](#create-complex-product). 


                              Products can also be Physical or Digital. 


                              * Physical products are typically products that
                              exist in a physical form, have a weight, and are
                              being sold by retailers with the intent of
                              shipping them to customers. 


                              * Digital products, on the other hand, may not
                              have a physical representation in the real world;
                              this includes downloadable products such as
                              computer software, ebooks, music, images, and
                              other digital media. Alternatively, a digital
                              product may be used to sell services such as spa
                              treatments, consulting, and so forth - which also
                              do not require shipping.

                              ## Digital Products


                              Digital products are purchaseable items that don't
                              have a physical representation and are not shipped
                              to the customer; for example, manuals, ebooks, or
                              music. A downloadable product file can be
                              associated with a digital product.


                              Downloadable product files are intended for
                              products of the “digital” type, typically for
                              selling some kind of media file or software.
                              Product dimensions are not required because the
                              item is not shipped.


                              Files must be added to digital products using the
                              [Control Panel or
                              WebDav](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Creating-Downloadable-Products/#adding-downloadable-product)
                              (attaching via the API is not supported).
                              Additional settings such as a description of the
                              file and maximum downloads can be set in the
                              Control Panel.

                              Product images are used to show shoppers what

                              Only one image can be the product thumbnail. The
                              product thumbnail is the image that shows on the
                              product listing page, in search results and any
                              other location that features the product. If only
                              one image is on the product it becomes both the
                              thumbnail and the main product image. Images can
                              also be added to
                              [variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variants).

                              Product Videos, in addition to images, can help
                              shoppers understand what they’re buying and help
                              sell the product. A product can have more than one
                              video.


                              * Product videos must be hosted on YouTube. The
                              video_id corresponds to the “v” parameter in a
                              video url.

                              Custom fields are a feature intended for product

                              example, there might be fields indicating
                              technical specifications about an LED TV  such as
                              screen size, maximum resolution, HDR support, etc.

                              grape, etc. Custom fields can not be used to add
                              rules such as changing the weight or price of a
                              product.

                              Bulk Pricing Rules are intended for merchants who
                              want to offer wholesale discounts for buying in
                              bulk. They apply once products are added to cart,
                              but they are displayed as a callout on the
                              storefront to let shoppers know how they can save.


                              Bulk Pricing rules in the catalog are on the
                              product, meaning that they’ll trigger even if
                              several different variants of the product are in
                              the cart, as long as the total quantity of those
                              variants meets one of the quantity breaks. [Price

                              Variant options are any choices that the shopper
                              needs to make that will result in the selection of
                              a variant. Color and Size are typical examples of
                              Variant Options.  A t-shirt can have different
                              combinations of sizes and colors.

                              * Color is a Variant Option while Red, Orange, and
                              Green are Variant Option Values

                              * Size is a Variant Option while Small, Medium,
                              and Large are Variant Option Values


                              The combination of Small & Red is what is selected
                              on the storefront and correlates to a product
                              variation also called a SKU. 
                               
                              **Variant options:**


                              * Require the shopper to select a value

                              * Only support “multiple choice” option types

                              * Rectangle

                              * Radio button

                              * Color swatch

                              * Product pick list

                              * Product pick list w/ images

                              * Will automatically generate variants when
                              created in the CP

                              is created with variants via V3 API Product /POST

                              Variants represent an item as it sits on the shelf
                              in the warehouse or a particular saleable product.
                              A product might be a t-shirt, while the variant
                              would be “a small, red t-shirt”. Variants are
                              selected by shoppers on the storefront via Product
                              Options. In the case where a product is simple,
                              meaning it does not have any options, the product
                              is its own variant - called a base variant.
                              Everything you can buy should be a variant.


                              * Options build out variants. 

                              * Variants are usually what inventory is tracked
                              against 

                              * Can have their own price, weight, dimensions,
                              image, etc - or they can inherit these values from
                              the product if they have not been specified

                              * Must have a SKU code (unless they’re a base
                              variant)

                              * In the case of non-base variants, variants will
                              relate to a particular combination of variant
                              option values - such as “small” and “red”

                              ## Create a Variant

                              Variants can be created in two ways:

                              * From existing variant options using the variant
                              options endpoint.
                              [v3/catalog/products/{product_id}/options](/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/product-variants/createvariant)

                              * By adding the variants with variant options and
                              skus when creating the product. See [Create a
                              Complex
                              Product](/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/products/createproduct).


                              This will go over using existing variant options
                              to create the variants.


                              Use the
                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products/131/options`
                              endpoint to get the option information.

                              and build out SKU’s use the following endpoint:

                                Variants need to be created one at a time using
                                this endpoint. Only one variant option at a time
                                can be created; individual variant options will
                                contain an array of multiple values. To use a
                                variant array and create them at the same time
                                use the [/catalog/product]() endpoint during
                                product creation.

                              The following example creates a base product,
                              variant options, and variants in a single call to
                              the /products endpoint. You can use this method to
                              create a product and its variants in a single call
                              without creating variant options first, but not
                              all option types are supported by this method.

                              Modifier options are any choices that the shopper
                              can make that will change the way the merchant
                              fulfills the product. Examples include:

                              * A checkbox to add shipping insurance

                              * Text to be engraved on the product

                              * A color that an unfinished product is to be
                              painted before it’s shipped
                               
                              Critically, the modifier will not change the
                              SKU/variant being fulfilled, and you cannot track
                              inventory against combinations of modifier values.
                              Modifiers typically would not change which product
                              is “picked off the shelf” in the warehouse, but
                              they change what happens to that product before
                              it’s sent to the shopper, or how it’s sent.
                               
                              Modifier options:

                              * May be required or non-required

                              * Support all option types

                              * Cannot be used as part of a variant



                              An adjuster can be added to a modifier option to
                              change things such as adding to the price,
                              changing the weight or shipping rules.  Adjusters
                              cannot be applied to all modifiers.

                              - checkbox with a price adjuster - increase price
                              by five dollars. Checkboxes have to made in two
                              steps.  The reason is that it creates more than
                              one modifier. A checkbox is a yes or no which is
                              listed as two different `option_values`.

                              Complex rules allow merchants to set up conditions
                              and actions based on shopper option selections on
                              the storefront. You can use them to vary the
                              following based on option selections made by the
                              shopper:

                              * Price

                              * Weight

                              * Image

                              * Purchasability


                              Adjustments made by complex rules are displayed to
                              shoppers in real-time on the storefront.


                              For the majority of merchant use cases, **best
                              practice** will be to either assign values (such
                              as a price) directly to a variant or use adjusters
                              on the modifier option itself. However complex
                              rules exist for rare cases where a rule condition
                              is too complex to express in those forms easily. 


                              Use complex rules when an adjustment should be
                              triggered by:

                              * The selection of values across multiple modifier
                              options

                              * The combination of a particular variant/SKU and
                              a modifier option value.

                              Complex rules must be based on a combination of
                              two or more modifiers, such as two checkboxes. The
                              following example will add $10 to the product
                              price when both boxes are checked.

                              Metafields allow a developer to setup key and
                              namespace pairs. The data does not appear in the
                              storefront or the control panel. This is useful
                              for when information needs to be passed back and

                              Metafields can be added to variants, products,
                              categories, and brands.

                              A product review is used to give shoppers the
                              option to rate the products they have purchased.
                              The reviews are located on the same page as the
                              product. 


                              Reviews are not able to be created in the control
                              panel, but they can be created via API. Creating
                              them via API is useful if you are migrating to
                              BigCommerce and do not want to lose existing
                              reviews. Product Reviews are native to the
                              platform but can be turned off in favor of a
                              custom setup.

                              They’re primarily used to tag products so that
                              consumers can find Brands they’re interested in
                              (such as Nike shoes). Brands have their own page
                              on the storefront which shows all the products in
                              that Brand. They’re also used as part of faceted
                              search navigation.

                              Categories are a hierarchy of products available
                              on the store, presented in a tree structure.
                              Currently, a store’s category structure determines
                              the primary menu structure of most storefront
                              themes, which are directly tied to it.


                              All products must be associated with at least one
                              Category, although a Category does not need to
                              have any products. Unlike some e-commerce
                              platforms, products on BigCommerce can be
                              associated with more than one Category. 


                              A product associated with categories does not
                              currently have any priority or weighted order
                              (there’s no “primary category”), which can make it
                              difficult to integrate with some external systems
                              which might wish to use a product’s categories to
                              map to a category structure in that external
                              system.

                        ## Script Manager API Partner Guidelines


                        With the Script Manager API, your Apps now have the
                        ability to insert scripts into a user’s storefront
                        without requiring the user to manually paste a snippet
                        of code into their control panel. You can freely update
                        these scripts while your App is installed, and, if
                        desired, automatically remove scripts if your App is
                        uninstalled.


                        For Apps being installed on our latest theme engine
                        (Stencil), this process is relatively straightforward.
                        However, if your App is already live, you may have
                        already asked merchants to paste a code snippet in one
                        of these two sections in the control panel:


                        - Footer Scripts

                        - Web Analytics


                        Also, since our older (Blueprint-based) themes do not
                        support the Script Manager API, you’ll still need some
                        way of providing users of older themes the documentation
                        they need, without burdening users of newer themes with
                        additional, unnecessary steps.


                        To help you transition to the Script Manager API, we’ve
                        provided some recommended strategies to deal with these
                        different situations. 


                        #### Stencil vs Blueprint


                        As mentioned above, BigCommerce supports two theme
                        engines: Stencil and Blueprint. Stencil is our latest
                        technology, and all new stores only have access to
                        Stencil themes. However, older stores may still be using
                        our legacy theme engine, Blueprint, which does not have
                        the ability to render scripts inserted through the
                        Script Manager API.


                        Because of this, you’ll need to check whether a user is
                        running Stencil to determine if their store supports the
                        Script Manager API. To do this, use the [Get Store
                        Information
                        API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v2/#store-information-reference)
                        endpoint and check the `stencil_enabled` flag. (requires
                        [store_v2_information_read_only
                        scope](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/#oauth-scopes)).

                        To better understand the content of this document, you
                        should be familiar with the app installation procedure,
                        which is outlined here:

                        ## Upgrades and Installation


                        ### Installing An App on Stencil


                        For Apps being installed on Stencil stores, we recommend
                        inserting your scripts immediately after receiving the
                        POST response during the Auth Callback flow. Add your
                        scripts using the Create Script endpoint of the Script
                        Manager API.


                        We highly recommend leaving the auto_uninstall flag set
                        to true, so that your App will properly clean itself up
                        when uninstalled. More information about this flag can
                        be found <a href="script-object-properties">here</a>.


                        #### Upgrading Existing Apps on Stencil


                        If your App has already been released, you may have
                        existing users with pasted-in code somewhere in their
                        control panel. There are a few possible ways to deal
                        with this situation.


                        1.) __Do nothing__


                        If you don’t need to upgrade existing merchants to the
                        Script Manager API, it’s perfectly fine to leave them
                        as-is. You’ll need to maintain documentation for the
                        manual uninstallation process so that merchants with
                        older installations know what to clean up, and you won’t
                        be able to automatically update or add scripts for these
                        users. 


                        2.) __Prompt merchants to upgrade__


                        If you want your merchants to gradually update to the
                        new Script Manager over time, you can prompt them to do
                        so on your App’s landing page. You’ll need to keep track
                        of which of your merchants are not using the Script
                        Manager yet to know whether you need to display this
                        prompt. Also, make sure to check that they are running
                        Stencil (via the Get Store Information endpoint) before
                        prompting them to upgrade.


                        Once a user decides to upgrade, you can walk them
                        through removing the old pasted-in code in their control
                        panel, and then, once the merchant clicks a button,
                        install your scripts through the Script Manager API.


                        3.) __Silently upgrade to the Script Manager API__


                        Finally, if it’s possible for your old, pasted-in
                        scripts to live alongside the new Script Manager API
                        scripts, you may be able to upgrade to using the Script
                        Manager API without any user intervention being
                        required. Whether or not this is possible will vary
                        depending on the implementation of your App.


                        While your merchants will be loading more data on their
                        storefront pages than necessary, this method will allow
                        you to transition to using the Script Manager API for
                        all of your installations immediately. Keep in mind
                        you’ll still need to document the manual uninstallation
                        process for existing installations.


                        ### Installing Apps on Blueprint Stores 


                        As mentioned, the Blueprint theme engine does not
                        support the Script Manager API. Any scripts inserted
                        through this API will not be rendered on any storefront
                        pages. To prevent unpredictable behavior should a user
                        change their theme, we highly recommend checking the Get
                        Store Information endpoint for Stencil support prior to
                        installing any scripts through the Script Manager API.
                        Additionally, you’ll still want to show the old manual
                        installation steps when a store does not support
                        Stencil. 


                        ### Existing Blueprint Installations 


                        Existing blueprint installations won’t be affected, but
                        remember that if you are prompting existing Stencil
                        users to upgrade to the Script Manager, you’ll want to
                        suppress this message for Blueprint users. 
                      header:
                        anchor: upgrades-installation
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ### Fixing Missing Scripts


                        It’s possible that your App installation may find itself
                        unexpectedly missing one or more scripts. Below are some
                        possible causes of this issue.


                        1.) __The Merchant Deleted Your Script__ 


                        Merchants are given a warning when attempting to delete
                        a script belonging to an App, but we do allow them to do
                        so.


                        If you want to handle this situation gracefully, we
                        recommend you check the [Get
                        Scripts](/api/v3/scripts.html#getallscripts) endpoint on
                        your App Detail Page (returned by the [Load Callback
                        URI](/api/#load-uninstall-and-user-removal-requests)) to
                        determine whether the expected scripts are present. If
                        they are not, you can prompt the user to click a button
                        to automatically repair their installation.


                        We ask that you request the user’s permission rather
                        than doing this automatically, as they may have had a
                        good reason for deleting the missing script. 


                        2.) __The Merchant's Theme is Not Set Up Correctly__ 


                        In order to render scripts, the theme templates must
                        have the handlebars expressions {{head.scripts}} and
                        {{footer.scripts}} in the pages where scripts should be
                        rendered. If either of these is absent, scripts on that
                        page with location set to head or footer (respectively)
                        will not be rendered.


                        Of particular note, {{head.scripts}} was only recently
                        added to the checkout and order confirmation pages in
                        our Cornerstone theme, and widespread adoption of this
                        standard outside of Cornerstone is still an ongoing
                        process.


                        To ensure your App is compatible with as many themes as
                        possible, we recommend footer over head for checkout,
                        order_confirmation and all_pages visibilities. 


                        3.) __Scripts Are Not Rendering in the Checkout and
                        Order Confirmation__ 


                        In order to render scripts, the store must have
                        BigCommerce’s Optimized one-page checkout enabled. This
                        is the default checkout type for all new Stencil stores.
                        Existing stores have to manually change the checkout
                        type as detailed in this article. 


                        Stencil themes from the marketplace support the
                        [Optimized One-Page
                        Checkout](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Optimized-Single-Page-Checkout#signup).
                        However, there could be instances where the merchant
                        maintains their own private theme and the theme has not
                        been updated to support the Optimized one-page checkout.
                        In this case, the merchant is required to add the theme
                        support, following the steps
                        [here](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/optimized-checkout-prereqs).

                        ## Notes


                        - If you are injecting scripts into the Checkout, you
                        will need to update the scope to Checkout Content.
                        Accounts can only be created by the [store
                        owner](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Store-API-Accounts/).

                        - Merchants will be able to see the scripts installed on
                        the store in the Control Panel. Within the native tag
                        manager, merchant actions will be limited to viewing a
                        script and deleting a script.

                        - Scripts can be located in the header
                        `{{head.scripts}}` or footer `{{footer.scripts}}`.

                        - Scripts Manager is only for Stencil themes. Blueprint
                        store users will still need to copy and paste in code.

                        - The current visibility options are `storefront`,
                        `checkout`, `all_pages` and `order_confirmation`.

                             `storefront`: All pages that are not `checkout` or `order_confirmation`.
                             
                             `all_pages`: Includes `storefront`, `checkout` and `order_confirmation`. This also includes the cart page. It **does not** include giftcertificates.php, 
                                            sitemap.php, account.php, and login.php.
                             
                        - Scripts injected via the Scripts API will not render
                        when you are developing a theme locally via Stencil CLI.

                        ## What is a Price List?


                        A Price List allows you to populate different versions
                        of catalog pricing and assign them to different
                        [Customer
                        Groups](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v2/#customer-groups).
                        The prices are specified exclusively at the variant
                        level. 


                        If an active Price List does not contain prices for a
                        variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The
                        association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be
                        done either via the Control Panel or using the [V2
                        Customer Groups API.](/api/v2/#customer-groups)


                        Price Lists will provide overridden price values to the
                        Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further
                        customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price
                        Object](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/price-object-properties)
                        in Stencil for further documentation.

                        a Price Record to indicate different pricing as the

                        - If a variant has a `Price Record` any existing
                        product-level bulk pricing will not apply in the cart. 
                        For variants without `Price Records`, any existing
                        product bulk pricing will apply.

                        The Customer Login API enables single sign-on (SSO). It
                        allows your apps to programmatically log in a storefront
                        customer by using the login entry point URL:
                        `/login/token/{token}`. Here, {token} must be a JSON Web
                        Token (JWT) containing the parameters for the customer
                        login request, signed by your application’s Oauth client
                        secret.


                        Example use cases for the Customer Login API include:


                        * Integration with a SSO provider or IdP

                        * Continuous login between a BC storefront and another
                        system, such as a WordPress blog

                        * Any login method other than BC's typical email and
                        password login - for example, if you wanted to enable
                        customers to log in via a phone number and SMS password

                        ## JWT


                        JWT is a standard for verifying a login signature
                        between two parties. For a full overview of the JWT
                        standard, please see [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/), where
                        you can find links to client libraries (in many
                        languages) that facilitate the generation and
                        verification of JWT tokens. BigCommerce also supplies
                        helper methods for generating login tokens in our [API
                        Client
                        Libraries](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/new-subpage).


                        ### JWT Standard


                        A valid JWT token is a string composed of three parts,
                        separated by periods (“.”), which correspond to the
                        encoded header, the encoded payload, and the signature.

                        ### Payload

                        The payload contains a series of claims that identify
                        the application requesting the login, the store, and the
                        customer to be logged in. Optionally, you can specify a
                        redirect URL to direct the customer to a page other than
                        the My Account page after login. 


                        Once a request has is made with a given `jti`, it cannot
                        be made again. This parameter is used to prevent replay
                        attacks by malicious actors intercepting the request or
                        obtaining it after the fact.


                        The `request_ip` field can be used as an additional
                        security precaution, to prevent a malicious actor from
                        intercepting the request and making it from another
                        browser or system before you do. If you supply this
                        value, BigCommerce checks the incoming request to ensure
                        that it is being made from the stated IP address
                        otherwise the request fails. We strongly encourage
                        setting this IP address value, but doing so is optional,
                        to support those cases where this information is not
                        available.

                        application registration in Developer Portal. |

                        | iat | integer| Time when the token was generated. This
                        is a numeric value indicating the number of seconds
                        since the [Unix
                        epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).|

                        | jti | string | Request ID string that must be unique
                        across all requests made by your app. A UUID or other
                        random string would be an appropriate value. Most
                        libraries contain a method for generating a uuid. For
                        testing a [UUID
                        generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) can be used,
                        but it recommended to use built in libraries.|

                        | operation | string | Must contain the string
                        "customer_login". |

                        you are logging into. |

                        | customer_id | integer | ID of the customer you are
                        logging in, as obtained through the Customer API. |

                        | redirect_to | string | Optional field containing a
                        relative path for the shopper's destination after login.
                        Will default to `/account.php`. |

                        expected IP address for the request. If provided,
                        BigCommerce will check that it matches the browser
                        trying to log in. If there is not a match, it will be
                        rejected |

                        The signature is created by signing the header and
                        payload with the hashing algorithm specified in the
                        header (HS256) and your application’s Client Secret.

                        ## Access URL

                        After generating the JWT token, your app should
                        immediately redirect the shopper’s browser to the
                        following access point URL to log the customer into
                        their account: `/login/token/{token}`

                        ## Logging in a Customer

                        The following tutorial will walk through creating a
                        login token. We recommend scripting this process since
                        the iat is invalid after 30 seconds. For the purpose of
                        illustration, this tutorial will walk through creating a
                        token manually using the debugger tool at JWT.io,
                        although doing so can be tricky due to time
                        constraints.  


                        **Prerequisites**:

                        Client ID and Client Secret generated from the store
                        with the scope set to [Customers Login]().

                        ### Create a JWT Token


                        1. Run a /GET request against the [Customers](http://)
                        resource (V2). Choose a customer and make note of the
                        customer_id. 
                      header:
                        anchor: create-jwt-token

                        type: success
                        body: >-
                          If you are unsure how to make a /GET request see our
                          tutorial on [making your first request]().

                      data: >-
                        2. Create the payload by filling in the PAYLOAD:DATA on
                        jwt.io
                    - type: code
                      data: |-

                      data: >
                        3.  Add your Client Secret in the Verify Signature
                        Section. Replace the text `your-256-bit-secret` with the
                        Client Secret.

                        4. Copy the token from the encoded box and paste at the
                        end of the login/token url.  


                        *https://store-url/login/token/generated-jwt-token*

                        5. Paste the URL into the address bar.


                        If the request was successful then you will be logged in
                        as the customer and directed to /account.php. If it was
                        unsuccessful there will be a login attempt message and
                        you will be directed to /login.php
                    - type: text
                      data: >-

                        ## Troubleshooting


                        * If the server generating the iat is out of sync, the
                        login token will fail if the timestamp indicates a time
                        in the future or an expired token.


                        * The login URL can be visited only once. Once a GET
                        request is run against the link, the token is
                        invalidated. 


                        * Tokens can be validated or generated for testing
                        purposes using the debugger at https://jwt.io/.


                        * Tokens will be valid for a very short timeframe after
                        they are first generated, so tokens should not be
                        generated in advance. Instead, the application should
                        generate the token and then immediately redirect the
                        user’s browser to `/login/token/{token}`. If you're
                        seeing issues related to your system time differing from
                        BC's server time, you can use the <a
                        href="/api/v2/#get-a-timestamp">/v2/time</a> endpoint as
                        a source of truth.

                        If your application interacts dynamically with the
                        BigCommerce storefront, and conveys information that is
                        specific to a particular logged-in customer, you must
                        confirm that customer’s identity within the insecure
                        environment of the user’s browser.


                        To address this need, BigCommerce provides a Current
                        Customer endpoint, which your app can access via
                        JavaScript on the storefront. This endpoint returns a
                        JWT with identifying details about the customer. The
                        information is signed with your [OAuth client
                        secret](http://).

                        Below is example JavaScript that will access this JWT.
                        To test the JWT functionality, you can install this
                        JavaScript on your sandbox BigCommerce store. Your
                        application’s Client ID must be included in the request
                        (to identify the requesting application):

                        ## Storefront Cart and Checkout


                        The Storefront API's are for managing the contents of
                        managing a shopper's cart using JavaScript in the
                        context of a storefront session. 


                        ### When to Use the Storefront API's


                        * Analytics and Tracking

                        * Displaying data (see Fetch below)

                        * Needing to run a quick API call

                        * Quick Order Form


                        ### Using the Fetch API

                        The [Fetch
                        API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
                        is an alternative to
                        [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).
                        It uses less code and works well with CORS. You can use
                        the Fetch API to interact with the Storefront API's and

                        using Internet Explorer, the Fetch API will not work. It
                        is recommended to use
                        [Polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) for Internet
                        Explorer 10+ and XMLHttpRequest for earlier versions.


                        Here we use `credentials: 'include'` to send them even
                        when doing a cross origin request.

                        You can also use the [Scripts API](http://) to add them
                        to a store in the footer section.

                        The Server to Server API's are for managing the contents
                        of shopping cart and checkout via OAuth. Using the Cart,
                        Checkout and Payment API this allows for a fully
                        headless ecommerce solution.


                        ### CaaS


                        Commerce-as-a-Service is possible with the Server to
                        Server API's. It allows for the underlying cart,
                        checkout, order and payment API's be called in a
                        seperate app. This mean using any framework you can make
                        API calls to lead a shopper through a custom experience
                        without having to use the BigCommerce front-end
                        checkout.

                        The Checkout JS SDK is a wrapper for the BigCommerce
                        Storefront Checkout API.


                        It allows for a developer to create a custom checkout
                        experience to move a customer through the checkout
                        process.

                        The SDK handles all the ‘heavy-lifting’ such as customer
                        login, getting shipping quotes and submitting payment
                        for an order.

                        With the Checkout JS SDK, you can build a [custom
                        checkout
                        presentation](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js-example)
                        layer in popular frontend frameworks such as React.

                        ## What Can I Do with the SDK?


                        -   It can initialize payment and shipping providers
                        that require client-side setup through a common
                        interface. Below are some examples of these providers:
                            
                            -   PayPal Express
                            -   Braintree
                            -   Stripe 
                            -   Square
                            -   Amazon
                            -   Klarna
                          
                        -   It provides a JavaScript interface for interacting
                        with the web API.
                            -   Fetch and submit resources:
                                -   Cart
                                -   Order
                                -   Customer
                            -   Fetch available options:
                                -   Shipping addresses
                                -   Shipping countries
                                -   Shipping states
                                -   Billing addresses
                                -   Billing countries
                                -   Billing states
                                -   Shipping methods
                                -   Payment methods
                         
                        The Checkout JS SDK allows you to present the checkout
                        process to the shopper in any way you like, and, through
                        frontend technologies and external web services, augment
                        the checkout with extra information. 


                        However, the Checkout JS SDK does not allow you to
                        change the underpinnings of the checkout - you must
                        still conform to the model of the Checkout API
                        underpinning the SDK to complete a Checkout and create
                        an Order in BigCommerce. 

                        The SDK does not allow you to implement custom payment,
                        shipping, or tax calculation providers into the checkout
                        - instead, the configured providers for these services
                        on a given store are expressed via our Checkout API.

                        A shipment is a grouping of physical items sent out to
                        one or more customers. A shipment can only be created
                        for an order.


                        V2 Shipping API allows for setting up Shipping Zones,
                        Shipping Methods, and Shipping Carrier Connections.


                        Order Shipments allows for a shipment to created for an
                        order. The shipping provider, tracking number and
                        shipping address id create a shipment.

                        Consignment can be created during the Checkout portion.
                        A Consignment supports multiple shipping addresses, with
                        each address having its own line items. A Checkout will
                        always have one Consignment assigned to it, which is the
                        first shipping address.

                        shipping method is how way an item arrives such as USPS
                        or FedEx. They can be set up using the API.

                        [Cornerstone](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone)
                        is available on Github as an open source software, and
                        will be the Stencil engined theme we reference in this
                        documentation in order to demonstrate Stencil's
                        capabilities in a fully functioning storefront theme.
                        Here is a demo of the [BigCommerce Cornerstone
                        theme](http://cornerstone-light-demo.mybigcommerce.com/).


                        Stencil also provides features that allow merchants to
                        customize a storefront's look and feel with no coding,
                        making Stencil a powerful and useful engine for all
                        audiences.

                        ## Stencil Development Features and Technology Stack


                        Stencil's provides the following features, allowing
                        BigCommerce theme developers to create beautiful,
                        dynamic, and powerful storefronts.



                        ### Stencil Command Line Interface (Stencil CLI)


                        The Stencil CLI enables developers to locally develop
                        and customize on any Stencil theme with no impact on a
                        merchant's live storefront during the development
                        process. When locally developing, you will have access
                        to real-time Browsersync preview and testing across
                        desktop, mobile, and tablet devices/viewports.


                        Stencil CLI runs on the Node.js runtime environment.
                        Installing Node.js also provides the required npm
                        package manager.


                        ### Logic-Based Templates


                        Stencil's logic based templates allow BigCommerce
                        developers to customize storefront pages efficiently
                        with the lightweight templating languge, Handlebars.js. 
                        Handlebars allows you to efficiently embed dynamic and
                        conditional logic onto your storefront pages.


                        ### Sass/SCSS Support


                        Stencils Sass and SCSS support allows developers to nest
                        properties, variables, and mixins. Use the familiar
                        Foundation framework (provided) or substitute your
                        choice of framework.


                        Stencil's Cornerstone base theme uses a BigCommerce
                        pattern library called Citadel, which is built on top of
                        the ZURB Foundation framework, version 5.5.3. Stencil
                        does not support Foundation 6.x, due to breaking changes
                        introduced between versions 5.x and 6.x.


                        Foundation offers the framework for creating a
                        responsive theme. You have the option of swapping out
                        Foundation for another framework, although doing so
                        would require significant work.


                        Foundation assets bundled with Cornerstone are located
                        in these subdirectories: 


                        * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/foundation/ `

                        * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/foundation/`


                        Citadel extends Foundation’s mixins and components to
                        provide Stencil’s own mixins, extensible components, and
                        utilities. These include drop-down lists, forms, and
                        similar resources. Citadel resources are named according
                        to BEM and SUIT CSS conventions. Classes are named
                        functionally, rather than based on visual presentation
                        or content. Our style guide is published here.

                        Citadel assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in
                        these Cornerstone subdirectories: 


                        * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/citadel/`

                        * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/citadel/`


                        More detailed information about the Citadel and
                        Foundation SCSS components, and their naming conventions
                        will be covered in *Components and Design Patterns*.


                        ### Page-specific Resource Definition


                        Specify the dynamic content you want to be displayed on
                        your storefront pages with YAML formatted front matter.


                        ### Javascript Event Hooks


                        Your Stencil themes can access remote objects through
                        event hooks, using the hooks to trigger defined events
                        based on shopper behavior. This will allow you to
                        collect product data and optimize a shopper's
                        experience.


                        To facilitate theme-building, BigCommerce provides the
                        stencil-utils client-side JavaScript library for
                        managing event hooks.

                        ## Stencil Theme Editor


                        The Stencil Theme Editor is a browser-based tool that
                        enables merchants to rapidly customize a theme's look
                        and feel with no coding. 


                        BigCommerce theme developers' configuration choices
                        determine which theme aspects merchants can customize,
                        and the range of choices for each aspect.


                        Stencil's Theme Editor graphical interface enables
                        merchants and store administrators to make styling
                        changes to the theme currently applied to their
                        storefront. 


                        As a theme developer, you have the capability to define
                        which style settings appear in the Stencil Theme Editor.
                        You can grant access to colors, fonts, display/hiding of
                        page features, and number of products/entries to display
                        per feature.


                        ### Stencil Theme Variations


                        Each Stencil theme can contain one to four variations.
                        You can optimize individual variations for specific
                        markets, audiences and styles – while still managing and
                        distributing all of these variations as one theme.

                        Cornerstone comes with 3 variations: Cornerstone Light,
                        Cornerstone Warm, and Cornerstone Bold.


                        ### Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Themes


                        BigCommerce stores powered by Stencil allow shoppers to
                        have a first class experience across any device.

                        Are you approaching Stencil from a different theming
                        framework, like Blueprint, BigCommerce's legacy
                        framework? Or moving to the Stencil templating
                        environment from a pure HTML and CSS-based design?


                        You have four (non-mutually exclusive) options for
                        developing Stencil themes:

                        For complete control over a theme's appearance and logic
                        – including the ability to edit _all_ theme
                        configuration files – you will want to use the Stencil
                        Command-line interface, also known as the Stencil CLI.

                        ## Front-Matter Quick Start


                        Stencil templates start with a section of "front matter"
                        where you can and concisely customize each page's design
                        and layout details. 


                        This front-matter section uses conventions from YAML, a
                        simple, widely used markup language. If you haven't used
                        these conventions before, refer to our [Front-Matter
                        Overview](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/using-yaml-front-matter).

                        ## Handlebars Quick Start


                        Stencil uses Handlebars.js to assemble dynamic content
                        into the storefront pages that are displayed to
                        shoppers. The dynamic content can be drawn from a few
                        sources, like the store's catalog.


                        Handlebars' syntax is quite simple, and it allows you to
                        accomplish powerful JavaScript operations with minimal
                        JavaScript code. To learn more about Handlebars.js, see

                        ## SEO Tips and Best Practices


                        Search-engine optimization (SEO) helps translate an
                        elegant theme into a successful, high-conversion
                        storefront. Because so many shoppers reach online stores
                        through a search engine, a search-optimized site will be
                        more visible – attracting more traffic. 


                        The Stencil framework is [designed for high SEO

                        However, you will want to keep SEO in mind as you build
                        out each theme and storefront. For guidelines, please

                        Interacting with the BigCommerce API

                        BigCommerce's growing API resources enable application
                        developers to create private scripts or apps that
                        support a single store, or to create public apps offered
                        to multiple stores via BigCommerce's App Marketplace.


                        As a theme developer, you can rely on apps to enhance
                        your themes' capabilities, and to extend or complement
                        the storefront features built into the BigCommerce
                        platform. Popular app areas include inventory
                        management, email marketing, coupons, reviews, shipping,
                        tax accounting, and security. For more information, see

                              Stencil requires the Node.js runtime environment,
                              version 6.x or later. We have tested Stencil on
                              selected Node.js versions, from 6.10.3 to 7.9.0.


                              We recommend that you install or update Node.js
                              using nvm. First install nvm, version 0.31.0, as
                              follows:


                              `curl -o-
                              https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh
                              | bash`


                              Next, explicitly install a supported Node.js
                              version, using this convention:


                              `nvm install 6.4.0`

                              Install Python 2.7.x for Windows. (This is
                              required for Visual Studio's Windows Build Tools,
                              installed below.

                              Python 3.x is not supported.)


                              In the installer dialog shown below, change the
                              bottom default, so as to enable the Add python.exe
                              to Path option. This provides global command-line
                              access to Python.

                              Stencil requires the Node.js runtime environment,
                              version 6.x or later.


                              On Windows, we have tested Stencil CLI on selected
                              Node.js version
                              href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v7.10.0/"7.10.0.
                              We recommend that you install only an LTS
                              ("Long-Term Support"/"Mature and Dependable")
                              version, and that you download that version's .msi
                              installer (not its .exe binary).


                              To verify your Node.js installation or
                              reinstallation, this [blog

                                https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/, etc. In
                                all cases, we recommend installing only LTS

                              After installing both Python and Node.js,

                              environment by running this npm command:


                              `npm config set python python2.7`

                                setup (and later refreshes), you will use this
                                command-line utility to install
                                packages/modules, and to configure and manage

                              Finally, configure Visual Studio within the
                              Node.js runtime environment by running the
                              following npm command.

                              (Replace the `2015` parameter with `2013` or
                              `2017`, as needed, to match the Visual Studio
                              release you have installed)


                              `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

                                        We recommend that you install or update

                                          etc. We recommend installing only LTS

                                        versions, from 6.10.3 to 7.9.0.


                                        We recommend that you install or update

                                        Next, explicitly install a supported
                                        Node.js version, using this convention:


                                        `nvm install 6.4.0`

                                        Install Python 2.7.x for Windows. (This
                                        is required for Visual Studio's Windows
                                        Build Tools, installed below.

                                        Python 3.x is not supported.)


                                        In the installer dialog shown below,
                                        change the bottom default, so as to
                                        enable the Add python.exe to Path
                                        option. This provides global
                                        command-line access to Python.

                                        Stencil requires the Node.js runtime
                                        environment, version 6.x or later.


                                        On Windows, we have tested Stencil CLI
                                        on selected Node.js version
                                        href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v7.10.0/"7.10.0.
                                        We recommend that you install only an
                                        LTS ("Long-Term Support"/"Mature and
                                        Dependable") version, and that you
                                        download that version's .msi installer
                                        (not its .exe binary).


                                        To verify your Node.js installation or

                              The first step toward developing on Stencil is to
                              install the Stencil CLI. 


                              You can do this via the following command (_If you
                              are using Windows, you will need to run this
                              command in git bash._):


                              `npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli`


                              ### Items to Note


                              * The command above requires <a
                              href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> to be
                              installed in your local development environment.


                              * In Windows, this <span
                              class="inline-code">npm</span> command's execution
                              might at times appear to freeze. However, the
                              installer is running. 

                              Give it several minutes to complete installation.


                              * On Mac OS machines with installed xcode, version
                              5.x, this <span class="inline-code">npm</span>
                              command has generated errors of the form: 

                              <span class="inline-code">npm ERR! invalid:
                              string_decoder</span>. The workaround is to
                              upgrade xcode to the latest stable xcode version 

                              (7.3.1 as of this page's last revision). 


                              * If you receive a file-permissions error, and you
                              did not install Node.js via <a
                              href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation">nvm</a>
                              (Node Version Manager), 

                              then either install nvm now, or follow one of the
                              workarounds on this external page:

                                To ensure the Stencil CLI is compatible with all
                                the changes introduced in Cornerstone 2.0.0, you
                                must upgrade to the latest version of Stencil
                                CLI (1.15.1) if using Cornerstone 2.x.x.


                                Occasionally, you will receive a command line
                                prompt to run the installation command when you
                                restart your Stencil server. This occurs when
                                BigCommerce publishes a critical fix in Stencil
                                CLI, to resolve an issue like a newly discovered
                                security exploit.

                              _Windows users need to run this in git bash._


                              Navigate to a directory where you would like to

                              If the above command fails, and you are accessing
                              GitHub anonymously, give the URL this alternate
                              prefix:

                              ## Creating OAuth Accounts


                              1. Log into the control panel of the store for
                              which you are developing. (Use the store owner's
                              credentials.)


                              2. From the left nav, select Advanced Settings >
                              API Accounts.


                              3. From the resulting Store API Accounts page,
                              select the Create API Account button.


                              4. Give your account a Name that reflects its
                              purpose. (The BigCommerce platform does not
                              validate this name – so just assign a name that
                              will make the account's purpose clear to you and
                              other store administrators.)


                              5. Under OAuth Scopes, set the Themes selector to
                              either modify or read-only.


                              (The read-only scope is sufficient to
                              authorize/initialize a Stencil theme. However, the
                              modify scope will achieve the same goal, while
                              also authorizing this account to upload themes to
                              the store from the command line.)


                              6. Click Save. As outlined in this support
                              article, doing so will display a modal, from which
                              you can copy your Client ID and Access Token
                              values. It will also prompt your browser to
                              download a .txt file that contains your
                              credentials.


                              You will need these values to authorize/initialize
                              your Stencil theme. If you're ready to do so now,
                              move ahead to Authorizing and Initializing

                              developers, repeat the process outlined in

                              (Even if you originally initialized your theme
                              using a legacy API [Basic-Auth] token, we strongly
                              encourage you to generate any new tokens using the
                              new OAuth flow. However, Stencil CLI will still
                              honor your legacy tokens to restart this theme.)


                              You can create up to 50 API accounts/tokens per
                              store. If you hit this limit and still need to
                              create new tokens, you will need to delete
                              existing accounts.

                                Deleting an account will invalidate the

                                developer using that token.

                              To access an existing OAuth token to authorize
                              your theme:


                              1. Open the .txt file that the BigCommerce control
                              panel generated when you created the API account.


                              (If you did not retain this file, you will need to
                              generate a new token by repeating the Creating an
                              API Account procedure.)


                              2. Note the Client ID and Access Token hashes in
                              the file (or in the control-panel modal for your
                              newly created token).


                              3. If you are a merchant granting an outside theme
                              developer access to your store, provide these two
                              values to the developer. They will need them when
                              [Authorizing and Initializing Stencil]().


                              4. If you are developing a theme against your own
                              store, you will use the same two values in the
                              same [Authorizing and Initializing Stencil]()

                              using an OAuth API account:


                              1. Have your store API account's Client ID and
                              Access Token hashes ready. 

                              (Refer back to the Copying a Token to Initialize
                              Stencil or Creating an API Account instructions.)


                              2. Starting from the subdirectory for the
                              appropriate theme (and store), initialize Stencil
                              CLI by running the following command (_Windows
                              users need to run this in git bash_):


                              `stencil init`


                              3. You will be prompted to provide the homepage
                              URL of the production store against which you want
                              to develop. This can be your own store, or a
                              client store that you are customizing.


                              4. Next, you will be prompted to enter the port
                              where you would like to run your store on your
                              local machine. This can be any port you like, but
                              we recommend using port 3000.


                              5. Next, you will be prompted: What is your
                              Stencil OAuth Client ID? Enter your store API
                              account's Client ID.


                              (If you used this Client ID when you last ran
                              stencil init, you'll see it hinted on the command
                              line, and can just confirm it.)


                              6. Finally, you will be prompted: What is your
                              Stencil OAuth Access Token? If you entered these
                              credentials when you last ran stencil init, you'll
                              see the token hinted in cleartext. If not, paste
                              your Access Token hash onto the command line. Then
                              press Enter.



                              Your terminal window should now confirm that you
                              have successfully initialized Stencil CLI on your
                              local machine. With Stencil CLI initialized, you
                              are ready to start Stencil and begin development.

                              Assuming that you set Stencil to run on `port
                              3000`, when you navigate to http://localhost:3000,
                              you should see the storefront to which you pointed
                              your local instance – but with the stencil theme
                              applied to it.

                              To run Stencil locally while also launching a
                              local version of Theme Editor, start in your theme
                              directory and run the following command, but
                              append the -e option:


                              `stencil start -e`


                              The Theme Editor server will run in parallel with
                              the stencil theme at
                              [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181/).
                              The use case for this is a developer who is
                              reconfiguring the Theme Editor/Store Design (check
                              terminology) settings. It is important to note
                              this is a tool to understand the experience
                              changes when editing the schema.json file. Making

                              ## Customizing Theme Editor's Port


                              You can override Theme Editor's default port by
                              appending the "--theme-editor-port [port]" option.
                              For example, to specify port 9000, you would
                              enter:


                              `stencil start -e --theme-editor-port 9000

                              `


                              To verify Theme Editor's launch, you would then go
                              to http://localhost:9000. Using this option, you
                              can specify any port between `1024` and `65535`.

                            data: '---'

                              ## Local Launch: Disabling Caching


                              By default, Stencil caches API resource data per
                              storefront page. This minimizes server traffic
                              while you develop your theme locally.

                              If you prefer to see your changes reflected
                              immediately in your live store, you can turn off
                              caching by appending the `--no-cache` or `-n`
                              option:


                              `stencil start --no-cache`

                              `stencil start -n`


                              ### To re-enable caching:


                              Kill the current Stencil server (_ctrl + c will do
                              the job_) and restart Stencil, this time omitting
                              the `--no-cache` or `-n` option.

                              3. Refresh theme dependencies by running `npm

                              3. Run `stencil init`.


                              *You will see the same error message as before,
                              but proceed.*


                              4. Delete the `<theme-name>/assets/js/bundle.js`

                              5. Run `stencil init` again.

                              This should now execute properly.

                              If you get unexpected error messages or unexpected
                              results upon executing the `stencil init`,
                              `stencil start`, or other Stencil CLI commands,
                              make sure you are working in the subdirectory for
                              the specific theme you intend to launch. 


                              One way of checking what directory you are working
                              in is by running the `pwd` command in your
                              terminal.

                              reinstall both the Stencil framework and Node.js.


                              ### Uninstalling and Reinstalling Stencil CLI


                              If you encounter persistent problems in
                              initializing or starting Stencil, you have the
                              option of completely removing Stencil CLI and
                              doing a fresh reinstall. You would do so as
                              follows:


                              1. From your command line, issue the command:

                              `npm uninstall -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli`


                              2. Navigate back to the Installing and Launching
                              Stencil section and repeat all installation steps
                              to reinstall dependencies and restore your theme,
                              according to your development scenario.

                                A more-drastic measure is to **also** uninstall
                                and reinstall Stencil CLI's Node.js
                                prerequisites (along with uninstalling Stencil
                                CLI). We do not recommend this, as it might

                              The syntax to run a basic Stencil CLI command is:
                              stencil <commands> [options] <parameter>.

                              Stencil CLI package supports, enter any of the
                              following forms of the help option on your command
                              line:


                              `stencil <command> [option] <parameter>`

                              You can use the `-f` or `--filename` option in
                              cases where you have already run `stencil bundle`
                              to bundle your theme, but the resulting .zip file
                              has not yet uploaded to BigCommerce. Use the
                              generated .zip file's **filename** as a parameter
                              to identify the generated file in your theme
                              directory. An example of the command is outlined
                              below.


                              `stencil push -f Cornerstone-2.3.2.zip`


                              In this example, `Cornerstone-2.3.2.zip` is the
                              name of the file that was generated after running
                              `stencil bundle`.


                              When you run `stencil push` with the `-f` or
                              `--filename` option, Stencil CLI skips all its
                              bundling steps and diagnostics. It proceeds
                              directly to uploading the specified file,
                              displaying its processing progress bar to show
                              upload status.

                              Cornerstone is the base Stencil theme, and it is
                              also the default theme for all newly initialized
                              local storefronts. Cornerstone provides the
                              standard file structure, base design pattern, and
                              default file assets necessary to start developing
                              a custom storefront experience.


                              The Cornerstone file structure consists of four
                              main subdirectories. Within those subdirectories,
                              you'll be directed to specific files in the

                              `templates/pages` contains all the base template
                              pages used in a BigCommerce online storefront. The
                              pages are grouped by page category. In order to

                              ## Setting Up BitBucket SSH Keys


                              To set up Stencil CLI for themes other than
                              Cornerstone, you must authorize communication
                              among your local system, the BitBucket registry,
                              and GitHub.


                              **Note:** _Steps beyond this point require that
                              you have active accounts on both BitBucket and
                              GitHub._


                              To authorize ongoing communication, you must set
                              up a secure shell (SSH) key that is shared between
                              BitBucket and GitHub. This is a multi-step
                              process, which is beyond the scope of this
                              documentation. However, we have tested the
                              following instructions and found them to be

                              1.10.0 or higher, simply use npm to install the
                              modules required to access Stencil JavaScript
                              events:


                              1. Navigate to your theme directory. This example
                              assumes that this target directory has the default
                              name Cornerstone:


                              `cd cornerstone`


                              2. Within that directory, install the
                              stencil-utils module to ensure that all your
                              dependencies are up to date:


                              `npm install`

                              follow the steps in the _Launching Stencil_
                              section.


                              Later, when you are ready to upload your
                              customized theme to a store, you should follow the

                              In order to keep your store and Stencil theme
                              performant, it's crucial to know the best way to
                              set up your customized Stencil theme in order to
                              smoothly incorporate future bug fixes,
                              enhancements, and updates that are applied to the
                              base theme. 
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'

                            data: "## GoRuck's Best Practices for Handling Theme Updates\n\nThe guidelines provided are from Web Developement team from the BigCommerce client, [GoRuck](https://www.goruck.com/). \n\nGoRuck's scenario addresses maintaining a single custom theme that is based on a third-party Marketplace theme (a theme other than Cornerstone). These guidelines can also apply to maintaining a custom theme based on Stencil's default Cornerstone theme.\n\n### Handling and Managing Theme Updates\n\n_We've made significant changes to our theme, and one principle that I've found successful is isolating my changes as much as possible. I try to put my changes into their own files, whether they're changes to templates, JavaScript, or SCSS._\n\n_I also name all my files, CSS classes and identifiers, and JavaScript methods and classes with a `gr-` prefix (as an abbreviation for our company, GORUCK LLC). Also, any changes I make to standard theme files are identified with a comment, such as:_\n\n`//Go Ruck Customization`\n\t\t\n_For example, I have a file in `assets/scss/` named `gr-theme.scss`. All of the styles I've added to the theme are either in this file, or imported by this file. So for styling, my only changes to the theme itself are in a handful of places where I had to change an existing theme style (identified with a comment), plus this one line in `templates/layout/base.html`:_\n\n`{{{stylesheet '/assets/css/gr-theme.css'}}}`\n\n_I've found that this approach provides several advantages:_\n\n* It makes it easier to distinguish my custom code from code supplied by the default theme.\n* It makes it less likely that my code will get intermingled with the standard theme code. This, in turn, prevents my code from unexpectedly being affected by theme updates.\n* It makes it easier to merge base-theme updates into my theme code.\n\n### Comparing and Merging Theme Updates\n\n_Having isolated my changes as much as I can, I identify theme changes and updates by comparing base themes, rather than by comparing base themes to my customized theme. When a new version of the theme is released, I download the .zip file from the BigCommerce Control Panel._\n\n_I then use a desktop diff tool (Beyond Compare) to \ncompare the new version to the .zip file of the theme's previous release. I ignore changes in the .zip file's\n `meta/` and `parsed/` folders, and to its `manifest.json`, and do a `Compare Contents` on the rest of the files._\n\nUltimately, I need to examine the changes carefully, to identify any changes that might affect, or be affected by, my customizations. And I need to test thoroughly. But comparing the stock themes to each other reduces the number of changes I have to examine. \n\nAlso, because I isolate my changes, most of the theme changes can be copied directly into the corresponding file in my customized theme. In practice, this means that I can limit my testing to the areas affected by changes in the standard theme, rather than having to re-test all my own changes.\n\nI personally find that it is also helpful to migrate *every* theme update into my customized version, as the update is released. If I were to wait, and to allow changes to accumulate and become more substantial, I think it would be more difficult to adequately test – and correctly integrate – the changes. Similarly, I'm grateful to the developer of our base theme (Pixel Union) for updates that have always made small, incremental changes.\n\n### Dynamic Content Injection\n\n_We've also come up with a variety of techniques for dynamically placing content on a page. For example, we can dynamically add tabs to a product page, using content stored on our WebDAV. Similarly, we can inject content from an external file into the body of a page. This allows us to put something that appears in many places, like a sizing chart, in a single place where it can be easily updated._\n\n_Or, we can use the BigCommerce control panel's various HTML editors – for Products, Categories, and Content > Web Pages – to inject content into predefined \"dropzones\" (custom div's). This allows us to generate a wide variety of content pages using a single custom template._\n\nAll of these techniques minimize the complexity of merging base-theme updates into our customized theme. For further details and examples on how we implement these techniques, see [Dynamic Content Rendering on Stencil Storefronts]()."

                              Updates


                              This section addresses two methods that will allow
                              you to keep your customized Stencil theme up to
                              date with Cornerstone's updates, enhancements, and

                              Updating Lightly Customized Themes

                              Updating Heavily Customized Themes


                              We've adapted these tips from a Stencil
                              developer's titled Stencil Version Control Best
                              Practices? on the BigCommerce Community forums.


                              ### Updating Lightly Customized Themes


                              In this scenario, you can use Git's cherry-pick
                              option to merge in specific Cornerstone commits.


                              Use the Stencil Framework Release Notes to look up
                              specific updates' commit hashes on the Cornerstone
                              repository.


                              See this Stack Overflow explanation of how to use
                              the cherry-pick option.


                              ### Updating Highly Customized Themes


                              Here, unexpected errors from automatic merges can
                              be time-consuming to undo. So, consider this
                              handtooled approach:


                              Use GitHub's Web interface to inspect each
                              Cornerstone commit (change) of interest. Each
                              commit will show you – for all changed files – a
                              diff view highlighting any deletions (left/red)
                              and any insertions (right/green).


                              For changes that you want to incorporate into your
                              theme, access the source code.


                              As illustrated below, you can either access
                              individual files via Github's Raw view, or you can
                              download a .zip of the whole Cornerstone repo in
                              order to access all files locally.


                              Manually edit the changes into your theme's
                              affected files.


                              ### Accessing Individual Files


                              In the file-by-file approach: For each commit that
                              you would like to incorporate into your custom
                              theme, do the following for each of the commit's
                              changed files.


                              In GitHub's diff view, click the View button at
                              the upper right. (We show it highlighted with a
                              red border and a tooltip.) You will see the file's
                              full contents, as shown below.


                              Click the Raw button at the upper right (which we
                              show highlighted in red). This will reveal the
                              file's full contents as plaintext – allowing you
                              to copy and paste without picking up the table
                              metadata used to display line numbering.


                              ### Downloading the Cornerstone Repository


                              This approach downloads all theme files at once,
                              allowing you to copy/paste their relevant contents
                              locally.


                              1. Navigate to the [Cornerstone Github
                              Repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone).

                              2. On the right hand side of the page, click the
                              green `Clone or download` button, and select
                              Download ZIP.

                              Stencil themes are Node.js applications, and
                              therefore contain dependencies on other JavaScript
                              libraries. For the default Cornerstone theme, we
                              provide the
                              [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) build
                              manager to handle these dependencies. 


                              As you develop and customize a theme based on
                              Cornerstone, you have option to reconfigure
                              Webpack's watched folders, and to even substitute
                              a different build system. These options are
                              explained below.


                              All themes in the BigCommerce Theme Marketplace
                              use Webpack. However, older versions of certain
                              themes used the jspm JavaScript dependency manager
                              instead of Webpack. Please see this page to
                              determine (by version number) whether you are
                              developing based on one of these earlier versions,
                              and to find the required jspm setup procedures.

                              To take advantage of automatic JavaScript bundling
                              and browser refresh, Stencil themes require the
                              [`stencil.conf.js`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/stencil.conf.js)

                              preview engine to watch or ignore, in two
                              respective lists. You are free to edit these
                              lists:


                              ```

                              var watchOptions = {

                                  files: [

                              ### JavaScript Rebundling: `development` Function


                              Upon the command-line instruction `stencil start`,
                              Stencil CLI will look for and call the
                              `development` function. 


                              In the base Cornerstone theme, we have created a
                              Webpack watcher to trigger a browser reload
                              whenever theme edits cause JavaScript to be
                              rebundled to the theme's `bundle.js` file. This
                              watcher uses options configured in the
                              `webpack.conf.js` file passed by `webpackConfig`.
                              So a JavaScript rebuild will refresh the browser:


                              ```

                              function development() {
                                  webpack(webpackConfig).watch({}, err => {
                                      if (err) {
                                          console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                      }

                                      process.send('reload');
                                  });
                              }

                              ```
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## Theme Packaging: `production` Function 


                              When you issue the command-line instruction
                              `stencil bundle`, to process and package a
                              completed theme for upload to a store, Stencil CLI
                              will look for and call the `production` function.
                              This function passes a callback as its first
                              argument to support asynchronous builds. 


                              The callback must be invoked somewhere inside the
                              `production` function to notify Stencil CLI that
                              the theme-specific build has completed and is
                              ready to package:


                              ```

                              function production() {
                                  webpackConfig.watch = false;
                                  webpackConfig.devtool = false;
                                  webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
                                      minimize: true,
                                  }));
                                  webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
                                      comments: false,
                                      compress: {
                                          warnings: true,
                                      },
                                      sourceMap: false, // Toggle to turn on source maps.
                                  }));

                                  webpack(webpackConfig).run(err => {
                                      if (err) {
                                          console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                          throw err;
                                      }

                                      process.send('done');
                                  });
                              }


                              if (process.send) {
                                  // running as a forked worker
                                  process.on('message', message => {
                                      if (message === 'development') {
                                          development();
                                      }

                                      if (message === 'production') {
                                          production();
                                      }
                                  });

                                  process.send('ready');
                              }

                        Two JSON files in your Stencil theme's home directory,
                        config.json and schema.json, govern which settings the
                        theme will expose.


                        The config.json file's key/value pairs define:

                        * Global, theme-wide variables

                        * Theme variations

                        * Variation-specific variables


                        The schema.json file specifies which theme settings will
                        be accessible through the Theme Editor GUI. Your entries
                        here also define the graphical controls presented to

                        _Block helper that returns the item at the specified
                        index._


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `idx` {Number}

                        * `returns` {any} `value`


                        #### {{itemAt}} Example


                        Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:


                        ```

                        {{itemAt array 1}}

                        //=> 'b'


                        ```

                        ---


                        ## {{join}}


                        The `join` helper is custom to Stencil. It joins an
                        array of string items, with separators. It returns a
                        string. 


                        #### Parameters


                        - `values`: {Array}

                        - `separator`: {String}

                        - `limit=<number>`: An optional limit.


                        #### {{join}} Example

                        ---


                        ### {{limit}}


                        The `limit` helper is custom to Stencil. It limits the
                        number of items returned from an array variable, and
                        returns a new array.


                        #### Parameters


                        - `data`: {Array}

                        - `limit`: {Number}


                        #### {{limit}} Example 


                        Assume that `{{cart.items}}` would return 10 items. You
                        could use this helper to limit that behavior to only the
                        first four items, by specifying: 


                        ```

                        {{limit cart.items 4}}

                        ```


                        ---


                        ### {{pluck}}


                        The `pluck` helper is custom to Stencil. For one or more
                        specified search key(s), it retrieves corresponding
                        values from some or all elements in a specified
                        collection. 


                        The `pluck` helper returns the retrieved values in a
                        comma-separated string. This helper's general form is:


                        ```

                        {{pluck ([limit] <collection> [<limit-value>])
                        '<search-key>'}}

                        ```


                        #### Parameters


                        - `limit`, `limit-value`: Optional parameters to limit
                        the number of results returned.

                        - `collection`: The collection to search.

                        - `search-key`: The string to search for.



                        #### {{pluck}} Example 1


                        Assume that the `categories` collection contains:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware" },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'name'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return:


                        ```

                        "Bakeware,Cookware"

                        ```


                        #### {{pluck}} Example 2


                        If the `categories` themselves each contained an image
                        object, then you could use dot notation to access that
                        image object's children:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware", "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Bakeware image"} },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cookware image"} },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cutlery image"} }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'image.data'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return a comma-separated list of image URLs.

                        Iterates over each item in an array, and exposes the
                        current item in the array as context to the inner block.
                        In addition to the current array item, the helper
                        exposes the following variables to the inner block:

                        Block helper that renders the block if an array has the
                        given `value`. Optionally, you can specify an inverse
                        block to render when the array does not have the given
                        value.

                        Opposite of [first](#first).


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `n` {Number}: Number of items to return, starting with

                        passed, you may optionally pass (as the second argument)
                        a `key` to sort on. Alternatively, you may pass a
                        sorting function as the second argument.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}: The array to sort.

                        * `key` {String|Function}: The object key to sort by, or
                        a sorting function.


                        #### Example


                        Given an array `['b', 'a', 'c']`:



                        ```handlebars

                        {{sort array}}

                        //=> '["a", "b", "c"]'

                        ```


                        ### {{sortBy}}


                        Sorts an `array`. If an array of objects is passed, you
                        may optionally pass a `key` to sort on as the second
                        argument. You may alternatively pass a sorting function
                        as the second argument.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}: The array to sort.

                        * `props` {String|Function}: One or more properties to
                        sort by, or sorting functions to use.


                        #### {{sortBy}} Example


                        Given an array `[{a: 'zzz'}, {a: 'aaa'}]`:


                        ```handlebars

                        {{sortBy array "a"}}

                        //=> '[{"a":"aaa"}, {"a":"zzz"}]'

                        ```

                        ## Advantages of V3 over V2


                        The V3 API introduces a number of improvements designed
                        to improve efficiency. Most tasks can be performed with
                        fewer API calls, and the V3 API supports the inclusion
                        of subresources within a request. For example, you can
                        now create a product with variants and custom fields in
                        a single API call.


                        Each V3 resource includes a `meta` object at the end of
                        the response, making pagination easier.


                        Additionally, metafields have been added to the V3
                        Products resource so data can be stored against the
                        object. Metafield values can be specific to your
                        application or visible to other applications.


                        Lastly, the V3 API has been optimized for performance,
                        allowing data to be synced quickly.

                        ## Products in V3


                        ### Variants


                        Every purchasable entity in the catalog is now a
                        variant, including the product itself. This enables
                        enhanced flows around inventory management, such as the
                        ability to solely use the variants endpoint to manage
                        inventory levels. For more on variants see
                        [Variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variant-options).


                        In V3 a variant needs to be created for every
                        combination of option values. In V2 it was possible to
                        create a SKU with a subset of product options.


                        We recommend creating products using V3 as BigCommerce
                        starts to move operations to the V3 API. 


                        ### Interoperability between V2 and V3


                        When a product option is created in V2 and assigned to a
                        product, trying to edit the option using the V3 API
                        returns a 422 error. 


                        ```

                        {
                            "status": 422,
                            "title": "The product is currently associated with an option set, please remove it before editing an option or modifier.",
                            "type": "https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api#api-status-codes",
                            "errors": {
                                "product_id": "The product is currently associated with an option set, please remove it before editing an option or modifier."
                            }
                        }

                        ```


                        This happens because in V2, options are created globally
                        before being assigned to products. In V3, variant
                        options are assigned at the product level. The way to
                        fix this error is to remove the option set in the
                        control panel or delete it using the API, then re-create
                        the options using V3 variants. 


                        ### Options and Modifiers


                        There is now a clear separation of [options that define
                        variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variant-options)
                        versus [options that are modifiers of a
                        variant](/api-docs/catalog/products/modifier-options).
                        This simplifies the creation and management of variant
                        prices and modifier adjusters and removes the need to
                        use complex rules, in all but the most extreme cases.


                        In V3, options and modifiers are attached directly to
                        the product, without the requirement to create an option
                        set beforehand.


                        Creating Options on V2 has several steps:

                        1. Create the product

                        2. Create the options

                        3. Create an option set

                        4. Assign the option set to the product

                        5. Create adjustments, such as price adjustment, using
                        rules


                        Creating Products and Variants on V3:

                        1. Create the product with variants in one call

                        2. Create adjustments, such as price adjustment,
                        directly on the variant or modifier


                        Variants can be included with a GET request to lower the
                        number of API calls being made using
                        `?include=variants`.


                        V3 includes an endpoint for creating a [Catalog
                        Tree](/api-docs/api-reference/v3-api/catalog/getcatalogsummary).
                      header:
                        anchor: v2-v3_products
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## What's not in V3


                        In V3, options are attached directly to products. So
                        option sets are not required, and v3 includes no
                        endpoint to manage option sets. However, V3 will respect
                        option sets that have been attached via V2 or the
                        control panel.


                        Moving forward, new resources will be built in V3 and
                        existing V2 resources will eventually be migrated to V3.
                        Some V3 resources do not have V2 counterparts, and vice
                        versa. 


                        ### Complex Rules


                        Most of the use cases for using V2 rules can be solved
                        by making adjustments directly on variants and modifier
                        options. We recommend using variants as best practice,
                        but in cases where an adjustment depends on the
                        selection of multiple modifier values, V3 includes a
                        Complex Rules resource.


                        ### Product Rules 

                        Any variant created in v3 with non-null core properties
                        (price, weight, image, purchasability) will create a
                        rule under the hood. The same goes for modifier
                        adjusters. These will show in v2 as product rules, and
                        any edits to them will be shared across API versions.


                        ### Option Sets

                        In our control panel’s Add/Edit Product section, any
                        products created by the V3 API will not have an option
                        set applied, but merchants can still edit the options.
                        If the merchant applies an option set to a V3 product,
                        the product's variants will be removed. Currently, the
                        Add/Edit Product area consumes the V2 API, so products
                        created and managed through the control panel will be
                        converted to the V2 model, using option sets.

                        ## Recommendations

                        When the resource is available in V3, it is best
                        practice to use the V3 endpoint. For resources that do
                        not have a V3 counterpart, like Orders, use V2. Both the
                        V2 and V3 APIs authenticate with Oauth and are designed
                        to be used concurrently within a single application.


                        We have created a handy [cheat sheet](v2-v3_cheat-sheet)
                        that lists all the differences between V2 and V3 of the
                        API.

                                                      ### Create V2 Products with SKU's


                                                      When using the V2 Products API to make
                                                      product options and option sets. The
                                                      simplest workflow is when starting from
                                                      scratch is below:


                                                      1. Create an Option (in this example
                                                      Size)

                                                      2. Add option values

                                                      3. Add the options created in step 1 to
                                                      the option set

                                                      4. Create an Option Set

                                                      5. Add options created in step 1 and
                                                      step 2 to the option set.

                                                      6. Assign the option set to the product

                                                      7. Assign SKU's to the Options on the
                                                      product
                                                  - type: text
                                                    data: >-
                                                      This will only create an option with no
                                                      values added.
                                                  - type: code

                                                      time can be created. In this example it
                                                      will take 3 seperate /POST requests to

                        To deter spam submission through storefront forms,
                        BigCommerce now supports Google [reCAPTCHA
                        v2](https://support.google.com/recaptcha/?hl=en#6080933)

                        ## Better Spam Deterrence


                        We recommend that all storefront themes take advantage
                        of this upgraded bot detection. However, BigCommerce's
                        legacy Blueprint themes were last published in our Theme
                        Marketplace before we implemented reCAPTCHA v2.
                        Therefore, please use the following instructions to
                        update your Blueprint-based theme with the
                        best-available deterrent against automated spam.
                      header:
                        anchor: better-spam-deterrance

                        ## How to Upgrade


                        To incorporate reCAPTCHA v2, you will need to update
                        script references in these three template files: 


                        * `Panels/CreateAccountForm.html`

                        * `page_contact_form.html`

                        * `product_comments.html`
                      header:
                        anchor: blueprint-how-to-upgrade-recaptcha
                    - type: callout
                      data:
                        type: error
                        body: >-
                          Please back up each file before making any changes. 


                          The instructions below are based on the default
                          Blueprint theme (Classic Next), as it was last
                          published in BigCommerce’s Theme Marketplace.
                          Therefore, the HTML markup will vary, based on
                          customizations you have already made to this theme, or
                          to other Marketplace themes.

                        ### Script Tag to Remove

                        Search each of the three template files for a
                        ``<script>`` tag like the following. If you find it,
                        delete the whole tag. (This script invokes a legacy
                        reCAPTCHA v1 challenge:)
                    - type: code
                      data: |-
                        <script type="text/javascript"> 
                         var RecaptchaOptions = { 
                         theme : 'clean' or 'white' 
                         }; 
                         </script>
                      header:
                        title: Script Tag to Remove
                      config:
                        mode: html
                    - type: text
                      data: >+
                        ### Variable to Remove


                        Alternately, you might see the same `RecaptchaOptions`
                        variable inside a different `<script>` tag at the top of
                        the same three templates. If so, delete the lines shown
                        here:

                    - type: code
                      data: |
                        var RecaptchaOptions = { 
                         theme : 'clean' or 'white'
                         };
                      config:
                        mode: js
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ### reCAPTCHA Script to Update


                        Next, in each of the three template files, replace the
                        "before" code block just below with the simplified
                        "after" code that follows.

                        Themes are built using a powerful template system that
                        enables designers and developers familiar with CSS and
                        HTML to modify the presentation and structure of a

                        Theme files that apply to a store design are organized
                        in several different directories, as follows:

                        *   **Panels**

                        ## Images


                        Theme specific static images (referenced from CSS, or in
                        image tags).

                        anchor: blueprint-images
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'

                      data: >-
                        ## Layouts


                        Layout templates provide the base HTML structure that
                        wraps storefront page content. Each layout file
                        corresponds to a specific page.


                        For example, `product.html` refers to the page that’s
                        shown when a customer is viewing the details of a
                        product.


                        Most layout files contain nothing more than references
                        to individual panels to be shown on a page. These panels
                        are contained in div tags that generally define left,
                        center, or right columns of the page.
                      header:
                        anchor: blueprint-layouts
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Panels


                        Panels provide reusable blocks or dynamic sections of
                        content.


                        For example, the `SideCategoryList` panel builds a list
                        of categories to be shown throughout the store.


                        Panels are generally referenced directly from layout
                        templates. They define which content should be shown on
                        a particular page and handle the generation of that
                        specific content.


                        Some panels contain strictly static content (such as the
                        store name) whilst others generate content dynamically.
                        Dynamically generated panels cannot be created ad-hoc as
                        they are linked to specific data and logic within the
                        application.
                      header:
                        anchor: blueprint-panels
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Snippets


                        Snippets are templates containing a fragment of HTML
                        that can be embedded multiple times in a page, either
                        from direct references or from being part of a loop that
                        iterates over the items in a list.


                        For example, the `HomeFeaturedProductsItem` snippet
                        renders each individual product listed in the
                        `HomeFeaturedProducts` panel.
                      header:
                        anchor: blueprint-snippets
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Styles


                        Primary layout stylesheets for the Theme, with
                        `styles.css` being the core file.
                      header:
                        anchor: blueprint-styles

                          As of November 2016, new BigCommerce stores are being
                          offered themes exclusively from BigCommerce's new <a

                          existing stores, the control panel's <NOBR><b>Themes
                          Marketplace</b></nobr> and <NOBR><b>My
                          Themes</b></nobr> pages will show only those Blueprint
                          themes that have been applied to the store and/or
                          purchased before November 2016. <br><br> 


                          This means that the workflow below will work only for

                        ## A Foundation for Creating Themes 


                        Our (legacy) Blueprint "Classic Next" base theme
                        provides a starting point for creating a new theme. This
                        theme includes responsive support out-of-the-box, so it
                        works with lower resolutions like those on mobile
                        devices. The visual design has been stripped back, so
                        you can create from a clean canvas.

                        ## Setting Up Your Environment 


                        Follow these steps to start developing using the
                        Blueprint theme:


                        1.  To enable the Blueprint theme on your store, simply
                        log in to the control panel, and place
                        <NOBR>`/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable`
                        </nobr>after `/admin`.<br>
                            (For example: <NOBR>`https://store-123abmy.mybigcommerce.com/admin/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable`.</nobr>)
                        2.  Apply the Blueprint theme.

                        3.  Connect to the site via <a
                        href="https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV"
                        target="_blank">WebDAV</a>.

                        4.  Once connected via WebDav, navigate to the
                        `/template/` folder, where you will have access to all
                        the files that make up a theme.

                        5.  To make a change to a file, just download the file,
                        edit it, and then upload your altered version.

                        6.  Every time you make changes to any files, you will
                        need to upload them through WebDAV for the changes to be
                        reflected on your site.

                        Here is how BigCommerce and our partners collaborate to
                        integrate a partner's theme changes/updates into the
                        BigCommerce Theme Marketplace (which merchants also know
                        as our "theme store"):

                        ## Prerequisites 


                        Integrating a partner's theme changes requires these
                        preconditions:


                        *   Partner has an existing theme in the BigCommerce
                        Theme Marketplace.


                        *   BigCommerce sets up a Theme Development store (or
                        converts an existing regular store) and applies the
                        theme. All theme files will automatically be copied into
                        the WebDAV `/template/` directory.
                      header:
                        anchor: theme-update-prerequisites
                    - type: callout
                      data:
                        title: Template Path Abstracted
                        body: >
                          The Theme Development store resolves the
                          %%GLOBAL_TPL_PATH%% variable into /template/.
                          Therefore, assets will be pulled from the /template/
                          directory, which is accessible via WebDAV or via the
                          BigCommerce control panel.
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Update Process 


                        1.  The partner switches on Theme Development mode, by
                        using:  

                        `http://<STORE>/admin/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable`.

                        2.  The partner asks BigCommerce to switch a theme.
                        (Partners currently cannot switch it directly, because
                        it’s a paid theme.)

                          This step will wipe out all files in the /template/
                          directory and copy in the latest version of the
                          integrated theme.

                      data: >-
                        3.  The partner pulls changes from BigCommerce's GitHub
                        fork, to get the most recent version onto their local
                        machine as well.

                        4.  The partner makes appropriate changes to CSS/HTML
                        files.

                        5.  The partner commits their changes into the feature
                        branch, and opens a pull request against the BigCommerce
                        fork.

                          If BigCommerce made conflicting changes (which should
                          happen only when resolving urgent issues), the partner
                          might need to rebase changes (using git rebase master)
                          in order to resolve the conflicts.

                        their Git URL to the BigCommerce Theme Marketplace.

                        7.  BigCommerce integrates changes into BigCommerce
                        Themes.

                        ## Other Requirements 


                        *   Partners must not change the repository's directory
                        structure or directory names.

                        *   Files should have permission 644 (`rw-r–r–`).

                        *   Directories should have permission 755
                        (`drwxr-x-r-x`).

                        Style Editor allows users to customize the look and feel
                        of their BigCommerce store, without needing to know HTML
                        or CSS conventions. Using a simple WYSIWYG interface,
                        users can edit colors and fonts, then see the changes
                        simultaneously in a live preview.


                        Style Editor uses Less.js as a CSS preprocessor. This
                        allows Style Editor to take advantage of variables and
                        other functions to ensure design consistency.

                        ## What Is Less.js? 


                        Less (formally, Less.js) is a CSS preprocessor that
                        allows theme designers to use advanced functions and
                        programming principles in their CSS. A JavaScript
                        compiler runs over the Less files, and converts them
                        into usable CSS that can be included in themes.

                        install Less, please see <a href="http://lesscss.org/"

                        ## Integrating a Theme with the Style Editor 


                        The Style Editor uses a specific group of files to build
                        its user interface, and to compile and generate the
                        stylesheet. BigCommerce’s base developer theme,
                        Blueprint, already contains these out-of-the-box. The
                        files are stored in the `Styles/less` directory.


                        The Style Editor depends on these files:


                        *   `style-editor-variables.less`

                        *   `internal-variables.less`

                        *   `init.less`

                        *   `theme.less`


                        ### style-editor-variables.less 


                        Style Editor uses this file to generate its user
                        interface. Here, you can enter variables for colours,
                        fonts and numbers that will help the merchant customize
                        the design of the theme. You can separate these
                        variables out into sections with headings to help
                        categorize the variables in a logical manner. No actual
                        CSS is written in this file.


                        There are some syntax patterns involved that Style
                        Editor will understand to help you customize the UI.
                        Special syntax:


                        `@color-your-text-here` — This is the naming convention
                        for a color variable. The style editor will generate
                        this as a color picker, with the value of the variable
                        set as the color picker’s default hexadecimal color
                        value.


                        For example:
                      header:
                        anchor: integrating-theme-style-editor
                    - type: code
                      data: '@color-header-background: #FFFFFF;'
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        This will generate a color picker with the label “Header
                        Background”, set to #FFFFFF (white) by default.


                        `@font-your-text-here` — This is the naming convention
                        for a font variable. The style editor will generate this
                        as a dropdown, preloaded with your theme’s predefined
                        fonts. The variable’s value will be preselected.


                        For example:
                    - type: code
                      data: '@font-page-text: "Open Sans",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;'
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        This will generate a dropdown with the label “Page
                        Text”, and with the “Open Sans” font preselected. The
                        dropdown’s other options will be the predefined list of
                        fonts you’ve provided.


                        `@font-declaration` — This variable will store all the
                        default fonts (and their fallbacks) for the style
                        editor. It will use these fonts in the font dropdown
                        mentioned in the above point.


                        For example:
                    - type: code
                      data: >
                        @font-declaration: '{ "Lato":["Lato", "Arial",
                        "sans-serif"], "Freckle Face":["Freckle Face",
                        "cursive"]}';
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        This will populate all font drop-downs with the fonts
                        “Lato” and “Freckle Face,” and if one of them is
                        selected, the fonts for that variable will be set to the
                        values in the corresponding array of fonts. For example,
                        “Lato” will set the fonts to “Lato”, Arial, sans-serif.


                        To use these fonts in the Style Editor, they must be
                        included in the style editor variables file through an
                        import. For the above example, you would include the
                        styles from Google Fonts like so:
                    - type: code
                      data: >
                        @import
                        url(//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato|Freckle+Face);
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >
                        `@color-declaration` — This variable will store all the
                        default colors for the style editor. It will list these
                        colours in the color picker’s palette after all the
                        color picker’s defaults.


                        For example:
                    - type: code
                      data: '@color-declaration: ''["#FF7700, #9966CC" ]'';'
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >
                        This will add a shade of orange and a shade of purple to
                        the end of the list of colors selectable in the color
                        picker.


                        `//! @section: your text here` — You can group variables
                        into sections with headings using this syntax to help
                        your users read and understand your variables more
                        easily.


                        For example:


                        `//! @section: Header`  

                        `@color-header-background: #FFF;`  

                        `//! @endsection`  of


                        This will create a section in the left navigation with
                        the title “Header”, which will house the “Header
                        Background” variable.


                        More information on syntax, and examples, can be found
                        in the comments of the style-editor-variables.less file
                        found in Blueprint.

                        ### internal-variables.less 


                        This file is for you to store the variables that you may
                        need to use, but don’t want the Style editor to see. For
                        example, you can use it to create a hierarchy within
                        your Less file, so that:


                        *   The user sets a value to @color-store-name;

                        *   in internal-variables.less, @main-accent:
                        @color-store-name;

                        *   in init.less, we set a:hover {color: @main-accent};


                        In this example, the link hover color will be set to
                        whatever the store name color is. We can add as many
                        selectors as we want to this css statement, depending on
                        our design.


                        This way, we can reuse the color that gets set to
                        `@color-store-name` as the color for elements that we
                        may not want to be edited in the Style Editor, but will
                        now carry on the colour of the store name to create
                        consistency within your design.
                    - type: text
                      data: >
                        ### init.less 


                        This is where you initialize the use of the variables.
                        This file contains all the CSS that will be compiled and
                        generated into the theme.css file. For example, the
                        @color-store-name can now be applied to the `#HeaderLogo
                        h1` element by saying:
                    - type: code
                      data: |
                        #HeaderLogo h1 {
                        color: @color-store-name
                        }
                      config:
                        mode: css
                    - type: text
                      data: >+
                        ### theme.less 


                        The file that ultimately gets compiled into `theme.css`.
                        This just uses `@import` to include the other three Less
                        files for compilation. The Style Editor will read this
                        file for instructions on how to compile your styles
                        using Less.


                        Compiling your Less files


                        Once you have finished working on your `.less` files,
                        _don’t forget to compile them!_ If you are using the
                        command line, you should be doing something similar to:

                    - type: code
                      data: |+
                        lessc Styles/less/theme.less > Styles/theme.css 


                      config:
                        mode: html
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        This will use the `theme.less` file to generate the
                        `theme.css` file into your theme's `Styles/` folder.


                        If you find that you have to make a change to
                        `theme.css`, please don't forget to replicate this
                        change in `theme.less` (but more preferably, in
                        `init.less`). Otherwise, every time you recompile the
                        less files, this change will be overwritten.


                        Less offers a variety of compilation methods, including
                        applications for both Windows and Mac that you can use
                        if you prefer not to use the command prompt/terminal.
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Testing Style Editor with Your Theme 


                        If you'd like to add Style Editor support to your theme,
                        you can enable the Style Editor on just your store.
                        Simply log in to the control panel and place
                        `/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable` after
                        `/admin`.<br>

                        (For example:
                        <NOBR>`https://store-123abmy.mybigcommerce.com/admin/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable`</nobr>)


                        This will enable [Developer Mode](#) for your store,
                        which also enables Blueprint and other features for
                        theme developers. You can [use Blueprint](#) as a basis
                        for creating new themes.

                          Adding product filtering to a theme is recommended for
                          experienced theme developers only. You must have
                          facility with HTML and CSS, and must also familiarize
                          yourself with how BigCommerce themes are structured
                          and operate. </li>

                          <li>

                          Product filtering is a Pro/Enterprise feature. To
                          enable it on an active public store, you must upgrade
                          to a Pro or Enterprise plan.

                          </li>

                          <li>

                          As noted below, we recommend implementing product
                          filtering on a temporary sandbox store. You can create
                          a trial store, and then upload your theme
                          customizations to that store via WebDAV to replicate
                          your local changes.</li>

                        ## Creating a New Theme with Product Filtering 


                        Product filtering is fully functional in the Blueprint
                        base theme. Once you’ve enabled [Developer
                        Mode](#blueprint-and-developer-mode), you’ll be able to
                        access this base theme and add product filtering to your
                        developer store.

                          As of that date, stores are being offered themes only
                          from BigCommerce's new <a

                        To enable product filtering, just enable [Developer
                        Mode](#devmode) on your store. This will enable product
                        filtering on your store by default, regardless of
                        whether or not your theme and plan support it.

                        ## Implementing Product Filtering in Your Theme 


                        Once you’ve enabled product filtering for your sandbox
                        store, you’ll need to get the most up-to-date Blueprint
                        files and copy them into your own theme. Here is how to
                        do so.
                      header:
                        anchor: implementing-product-filtering-your-theme
                    - type: callout
                      data:

                        body: >-
                          As noted above, the Blueprint base theme is now
                          available only to stores that applied it before
                          November 2016.

                      data: >-
                        1.  Enable [Developer Mode](#devmode) in your sandbox
                        store, if you haven’t already. This will enable the
                        Blueprint theme and the faceted search feature.

                        2.  Unless you’re starting from scratch, back up your
                        theme customizations.

                        3.  Select Blueprint as your store’s theme. 

                        4.  Download the Blueprint theme – don’t worry, you’ll
                        only need certain files for faceted search.

                        5.  Restore your theme from the backups you downloaded
                        in step 2.

                        6.  Upload the following files from Blueprint to your
                        sandbox store:
                           *   `Panels/FacetedSearch.html` – This panel contains the markup for your Faceted Search column. It calls all the panels for each of the searchable facets as well.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchProductGrid.html` - This panel contains the markup for your list of product results when your category lists are set to "grid view".
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchProductList.html` - This panel contains the markup for your list of product results when your category lists are set to "list view".
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateCategory.html` – The panel that contains the markup for the Category facet.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateMultichoice.html` – The panel that contains the markup for any facet containing multiple-choice check boxes.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateRange.html` – The panel that contains the markup for facets containing ranges.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateRating.html` – The panel that contains the markup for the Rating facet.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateShowing.html` – The panel that contains the markup for the list of currently selected filters.
                            *   `Panels/FacetedSearchTemplateSingle.html` – The panel that contains the markup for any facet containing single-choice radio buttons.
                            *   `Panels/Pagination.html` – The panel that contains the markup for your pagination – note that this will not use any existing pagination panels that your theme may have.
                            *   `Styles/faceted-search.css` – This will be included in `FacetedSearch.html`, so you don’t need to add it to your `HTMLHead.html` file.

                        7.  Copy your `brands.html` page and name it
                        `brands_with_facets.html`.

                        8.  Copy your `search.html` page and name it
                        `search_with_facets.html`.

                        9.  Copy your `category.html` page and name it
                        `category_with_facets.html`.

                        10.  Include the required assets on your new facets
                        pages. You can use the facets pages from Blueprint for
                        reference (the assets will be named the same):
                           *   `%%Panel.FacetedSearch%%` – This is the main Faceted Search panel, and will call the rest of the panels it needs accordingly (including required JavaScript and CSS).
                            *   Add the `js-faceted-search-column` class to the container of your Faceted Search panel.
                            *   If you have a responsive theme, you can add the `Refine` button to your page, which toggles the Faceted Search column on or off. By default, this button displays only on mobile:<br>
                            `<button class="js-faceted-search-action btn"> %%LNG_FilterBy%% </button>`
                        11.  If the pages mentioned above don’t exist, you can
                        copy the existing pages from the Blueprint theme. Keep
                        in mind that you’ll need to modify these pages to suit
                        the structure of your theme.

                        ## Allowing For Filtering On/Off 


                        When faceted search is switched on, the following
                        templates will be used:


                        *   Brand pages > `brands_with_facets.html`

                        *   Search page > `search_with_facets.html`

                        *   Category pages > `category_with_facets.html`


                        When switched off:


                        *   Brand pages > `brands.html`

                        *   Search page > `search.html`

                        *   Category pages > `category.html`

                          <code>category.html</code> pages to include faceted
                          search. Clients who are not on a Pro or Enterprise
                          plan do not get faceted search, so if you include it
                          on <code>category.html</code>, <code>brand.html</code>
                          or <code>search.html</code> page, your theme will be
                          useless to those clients.

                        ## Category Filtering Details 


                        When you turn on product filtering for a store, it will
                        automatically switch all `Category Layout File`s to your
                        new `category_with_facets.html` page. To view product
                        filtering on Category pages, you must ensure that the
                        `Category Layout File` is set to
                        `category_with_facets.html`.


                        You will not see the Category filter on storefront
                        Category pages. This has been hidden for SEO reasons.

                      data: >-
                        Each of the layout, panel, and snippet files in a theme
                        uses variables (also called placeholders) to show
                        external content or content fetched from the database
                        (such as the name of a product).


                        Template variables are enclosed within `%%` markers.
                        These types of variables are available for use in
                        templates: global variables, string variables, panel
                        references, snippet references, and file includes.

                        ## Global-Variables References 



                        Global variables are used to render dynamic content into
                        a template. Global variables are referenced using the
                        following syntax:


                        <pre>%%GLOBAL_[placeholder_name]%%</pre>


                        For example:


                        <pre>%%GLOBAL_ProductName%%</pre>


                        Specific variables' availability depends on the layout
                        template that you're editing. For example, the variable
                        for a product's description is available on the product
                        details page, but not on the category view/product
                        listing page.
                      header:
                        anchor: global-variables-references
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Panel References 


                        Panels are the different blocks used by BigCommerce to
                        build a page. Panels are referenced both inside layout
                        files and inside other panel files.


                        Panels are referenced in templates as follows, where
                        `[panel_name]` is a placeholder for the name of a file
                        in the theme’s Panels directory:


                        <pre>%%Panel.[panel_name]%%</pre>


                        For example:


                        <pre>%%Panel.HomeFeaturedProducts%%</pre>


                        This panel reference will load in the content from the
                        `Panels/HomeFeaturedProducts.html` panel file.
                      header:
                        anchor: panel-references
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Snippet References 


                        Snippets are templates containing HTML, which you can
                        use multiple times on one page – either by using them in
                        different parts of the template, or by including them a
                        loop. For example, a loop might build a list of products
                        on the page, with each product in the list being a
                        repeated version of the same snippet.


                        Snippets are referenced in templates as follows:


                        <pre>%%SNIPPET_[snippet_name]%%</pre>


                        In most cases, this will correspond to a similarly named
                        file in the theme’s Snippets directory. For example:


                        <pre>%%SNIPPET_HomeFeaturedProducts%%</pre>


                        This snippet reference will contain repeated copies of
                        `Snippets/HomeFeaturedProductsItem.html`, one for each
                        featured product to be shown in the list.
                      header:
                        anchor: snippet-references
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## Referencing Distributed Theme Assets 


                        After the Blueprint framework was first released,
                        BigCommerce added the ability to reference theme assets
                        that are stored remotely on a CDN (content delivery
                        network). This section provides examples that map
                        first-generation Blueprint syntax to updated syntax for
                        distributed assets.


                        You can use WebDAV to upload your own custom theme
                        assets (JavaScripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, etc).
                        In your HTML, reference these assets that aren’t present
                        in the base theme using the `ASSET` syntax:


                        <pre>%%ASSET_[path_to_asset]%%</pre>


                        This syntax will output an absolute URL like: 


                        <pre>http://cdn-host/templates/__custom/path_to_asset?t=timestamp`</pre>


                        This loads the custom asset from our CDN server, and
                        includes a cache-busting querystring.


                        For example:


                        <pre>%%ASSET_Styles/myownstyle.css%%</pre>


                        ...will be output as:


                        <pre>http://cdn-host/templates/__custom/Styles/myonwstyle.css?t=123</pre>
                      header:
                        anchor: referencing-distributed-theme-assets

                        ##### Assets Outside of the /template/ Directory 


                        The `ASSET` variable can be used only with files and
                        folders inside the `/template/` directory. To take
                        advantage of a CDN's benefits, we strongly recommend
                        moving your assets to the `/template/` directory.
                        However, if you need to keep assets outside of the
                        `/template/` directory, the best practice is to use
                        _protocol-relative_, absolute or fully qualified, URLs.
                        Here are some examples:


                        ```

                        <img src="//mystore.com/content/images/foo.jpg" />

                        url(//mystore.com/content/images/foo.jpg")

                        <link href="//mystore.com/content/foo.css"
                        rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

                        ```
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'
                    - type: text
                      data: >-
                        ## File Includes 


                        You can include another file within a template, using
                        file include variables. This practice is extremely
                        useful for external files such as banners or
                        site-network headers.


                        Includes are referenced within template files as
                        follows:


                        <pre>

                        %%Include.http://www.example.com/remote_file.html%%

                        %%Include.https://www.example.com/secure_remote_file.html%%</pre>


                        Notes: Included external links will not follow redirects
                        (http status code 301 or 302). So if a redirect is
                        encountered, it will not include the content.

                        To support stores that enable BigCommerce's Optimized
                        One-Page Checkout feature, you can customize the
                        Optimized Checkout page's styling within your theme. You
                        do this by adding custom CSS to the
                        `optimized-checkout-webdav.css` template file that we
                        provide. You can download the template as a <a
                        href="/assets/optimized-checkout-webdav.css.zip">.zip
                        file here</a>, or copy the CSS [below](#css-skeleton).

                          functions throughout this template file's CSS, this
                          version of the CSS is designed to be fully compatible
                          with Blueprint themes.

                        ## Customization Options/Restrictions 


                        As a theme developer, you are free to change classes'
                        contents – but do not nest elements, nor change any
                        class names. 


                        The structure and class naming are reserved because each
                        class here maps to multiple Optimized Checkout elements.
                        So renaming would break updates available in future
                        Optimized Checkout enhancements.
                      header:
                        anchor: customization-options-restrictions
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'

                      data: >
                        ## Configuring the Desktop Viewport 


                        Within the CSS file, to set up Optimized Checkout's
                        responsive features, you should configure the following
                        breakpoint to define your preferred desktop viewport
                        size:
                      header:
                        anchor: configuring-desktop-viewport
                    - type: code
                      data: >-

                        // TODO:

                        // Configure media query to be 'desktop' breakpoint size

                        //
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        @media (min-width: 801px) {
                            text-align: stencilString("optimizedCheckout-logo-position");
                        }

                      data: >
                        For other customization options, please see the class
                        descriptions [below](#classes-provided).

                        ## Deploying Custom CSS 


                        To deploy your custom CSS to a BigCommerce store, you
                        will need to upload your `optimized-checkout-webdav.css`
                        file (once customized) via WebDAV. 


                        For a general overview of the process, please see [this
                        support
                        article](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Accessing-and-Customizing-Template-Files/).
                        Place your customized `optimized-checkout-webdav.css`
                        file directly within WebDAV's `/content/` folder.


                        For details on interacting with WebDAV, please see [this
                        article](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Connecting-to-WebDav).
