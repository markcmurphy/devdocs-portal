## Gift Certificates
Gift Certificates are a record of store credit that can be used to pay for an order when the shopper enters a gift certificate code. 

**Notes**
<br>

- When a gift certificate is created through the API, no email notification is triggered to the specified recipient.
- Gift Certificates are not tied to the Customer Account associated with the `to_email` of the recipient. They are redeemed via the unique code.
- Gift Certificates cannot be managed or created via the Control Panel. They can only be created via the storefront, or via API.
