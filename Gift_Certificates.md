## Gift Certificates
Gift Certificates are a record of store credit that can be used to pay for orders when a shopper enters the gift certificate code at checkout.

**Notes**
<br>

- When a gift certificate is created through the API, no email notification is triggered to the specified recipient.
- Gift Certificates are not tied to the [Customer Account](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Customer-Account-Creation) associated with the `to_email` of the recipient. They are redeemed via the unique code.
- Gift Certificates cannot be managed or created via the Control Panel. They can only be created via the storefront, or via API.
