                        framework, like BigCommerce's legacy Blueprint
                        framework? Are you moving to the Stencil templating
                        environment from pure HTML and CSS-based design?

                        ###  Find a Design & Solutions Partner


                        If you prefer to have an expert collaborator customize
                        your theme, we recommend working with one of our

                        ### Light Customization – Graphical Theme Editor


                        Stencil can be customized without the use of any
                        specialized development tools or techniques by using of
                        the Stencil Theme Editor. The Stencil Theme Editor still
                        enables customization of a theme's colors, typography,
                        banners, headings, carousel, and footer. It also enables
                        customization of broader layout characteristics, such as
                        the number of products displayed in various panels,
                        category pages, and brand pages.

                        For complete control over a theme's appearance and logic
                        – including the ability to edit _all_ theme
                        configuration files – you will want to use the Stencil
                        CLI (command-line interface) framework. Stencil CLI is
                        described in detail in the remainder of this
                        documentation. 


                        To get up to speed on Stencil&#160;CLI's templating
                        conventions, please see the Quick Start sections just

                        ## Front-Matter Quick Start


                        Stencil templates start with a section of "front matter"
                        where you can and concisely customize each page's design
                        and layout details. 


                        This front-matter section uses conventions from YAML, a
                        simple, widely used markup language. If you haven't used
                        these conventions before, refer to our [Front-Matter
                        Overview](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/using-yaml-front-matter).

                        ## Handlebars Quick Start


                        Stencil uses Handlebars.js to assemble dynamic content
                        into the storefront pages that are displayed to
                        shoppers. The dynamic content can be drawn from a few
                        sources, like the store's catalog.


                        Handlebars' syntax is quite simple, and it allows you to
                        accomplish powerful JavaScript operations with minimal
                        JavaScript code. To learn more about Handlebars.js, see

                        ## SEO Tips/Best Practices


                        Search-engine optimization (SEO) helps translate an
                        elegant theme into a successful, high-conversion
                        storefront. Because so many shoppers reach online stores
                        through a search engine, a search-optimized site will be
                        more visible – attracting more traffic. 


                        The Stencil framework is [designed for high SEO
                        performance](https://www.bigcommerce.com/improve-organic-traffic/).
                        However, you will want to keep SEO in mind as you build
                        out each theme and storefront. For guidelines, please

                        The diagram below looks complex because it shows _all_
                        currently supported workflows for setting up Stencil.
                        However, for a typical initial setup – incorporating the
                        default Cornerstone reference theme – you would just
                        follow the black arrows straight down from top to
                        bottom.


                        Here are the color codes for each setup scenario, with
                        links to details about individual steps:


                        * Black: Basic initial setup, relying on default
                        Cornerstone theme. 

                        * Purple: Customize a theme downloaded from Theme
                        Marketplace (_other than_ Cornerstone). 

                        * Orange: Refresh Cornerstone from Theme Marketplace. 

                        * Green: Configure a custom JavaScript build system, to
                        avoid dependence on Webpack and jspm.

                        * Blue: Adds onto any of the preceding four scenarios.
                        If developing for a BigCommerce Blueprint production
                        store launched before Jan. 26, 2016, you must add one
                        extra step to enable Stencil in the store's control
                        panel.

                        ## Initial Cornerstone-Based Setup 


                        Start developing based on BigCommerce's default
                        Cornerstone theme. This is a streamlined workflow, using
                        Webpack as its JavaScript build system. Steps required:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Clone default Cornerstone theme

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Prepare Store and Tokens

                        * Proceed to Launching Stencil

                        BigCommerce's Theme Marketplace. Steps required:


                        * Assume all prerequisites installed and Stencil CLI
                        installed

                        * Download fresh Cornerstone .zip

                        * Reinstall JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Repeat Launching Stencil

                        Queen) downloaded from BigCommerce's Theme Marketplace.
                        This workflow requires BitBucket, and some earlier theme
                        versions require additional steps for the jspm
                        JavaScript build system. Steps required:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Set up BitBucket, download .zip, and install
                        JavaScript dependencies

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Prepare Store and Tokens

                        JavaScript build system. Steps recommended:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Clone default Cornerstone theme

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                          have already begun development, first back up at least
                          your theme's .stencil file. This file contains your
                          store URL, your BigCommerce username and access

                        Cornerstone, Diamond, or Queen theme from the store
                        control panel's Storefront area: 


                        * If you have not yet added Cornerstone (or
                        Diamond/Queen) to your store, start at Themes

                        Go to Storefront -> My Themes.


                        Unpack the zipped theme to a working directory.


                        (This can be the directory where you have been
                        developing your theme, or a new directory.)


                        Reinstalling Dependencies and Relaunching 


                        Ensure that your theme includes all current
                        dependencies, by repeating JavaScript
                        Utilitiesinstallation.
                          
                        Repeat the steps listed in the Launching Stencil
                        subsection


                        Next, ensure that your theme includes all current
                        dependencies by re-running npm, as follows:


                        Navigate to your theme directory. This example assumes
                        that this target directory has the default name stencil


                        `cd stencil`


                        `npm install`


                        You are now ready to resume development of your theme.
                        Please proceed to Launching Stencil


                        Later, when you are ready to upload your customized
                        theme to a store, you should follow the zipping and

                        How best to set up your customized Stencil theme to
                        smoothly incorporate future updates in its base theme?
                        We're gratefully sharing these guidelines from Ken
                        Utting, Web Developer for BigCommerce client
                        [goruck.com](https://www.goruck.com/). His scenario
                        (slightly edited here) addresses maintaining a single
                        custom theme that is based on a third-party Marketplace
                        theme. But&#160;these guidelines also apply to
                        maintaining one, or multiple, themes based on Stencil's
                        default Cornerstone theme.
                    - type: text
                      data: "## Best Practices for Handling Theme Updates\n\nWe've made significant changes to our theme, and one principle that I've found successful is isolating my changes as much as possible. I try to put my changes into their own files, whether they're changes to templates, JavaScript, or SCSS. \n\nI also name all my files, CSS classes and identifiers, and JavaScript methods and classes with a `gr-` prefix (as an abbreviation for our company, GORUCK LLC). Also, any changes I make to standard theme files are identified with a comment, such as: \n\n`Go Ruck Customization`\n\t\t\nFor example, I have a file in `assets/scss/` named `gr-theme.scss`. All of the styles I've added to the theme are either in this file, or imported by this file. So for styling, my only changes to the theme itself are in a handful of places where I had to change an existing theme style (identified with a comment), plus this one line in `templates/layout/base.html`:\n\n`{{{stylesheet '/assets/css/gr-theme.css'}}}`\n\nI've found that this approach provides several advantages: \n\n* It makes it easier to distinguish my custom code from code supplied by the default theme.\n* It makes it less likely that my code will get intermingled with the standard theme code. This, in turn, prevents my code from unexpectedly being affected by theme updates.\n* It makes it easier to merge base-theme updates into my theme code.\n\n##### Comparing and Merging Apples to Apples\n\nHaving isolated my changes as much as I can, I identify theme changes by comparing stock (base) themes, rather than by comparing base themes to my customized theme. When a new version of the theme is released, I download the .zip file from the BigCommerce control panel. \n\nI then use a desktop diff tool (Beyond Compare) to \ncompare the new version to the .zip file of the theme's previous release. I ignore changes in the .zip file's\n `meta/` and `parsed/` folders, and to its `manifest.json`, and do a `Compare Contents` on the rest of the files.\n\nUltimately, I need to examine the changes carefully, to identify any changes that might affect, or be affected by, my customizations. And I need to test thoroughly. But comparing the stock themes to each other reduces the number of changes I have to examine. \n\nAlso, because I isolate my changes, most of the theme changes can be copied directly into the corresponding file in my customized theme. In practice, this means that I can limit my testing to the areas affected by changes in the standard theme, rather than having to re-test all my own changes.\n\nI personally find that it is also helpful to migrate *every* theme update into my customized version, as the update is released. If I were to wait, and to allow changes to accumulate and become more substantial, I think it would be more difficult to adequately test – and correctly integrate – the changes. Similarly, I'm grateful to the developer of our base theme (Pixel Union) for updates that have always made small, incremental changes.\n\n##### Dynamic Content Injection\n\nFinally, we've also come up with a variety of techniques for dynamically placing content on a page. For example, we can dynamically add tabs to a product page, using content stored on our WebDAV. Similarly, we can inject content from an external file into the body of a page. This allows us to put something that appears in many places, like a sizing chart, in a single place where it can be easily updated. \n\nOr, we can use the BigCommerce control panel's various HTML editors – for Products, Categories, and Content > Web Pages – to inject content into predefined \"dropzones\" (custom div's). This allows us to generate a wide variety of content pages using a single custom template.\n\nAll of these techniques move content out of the theme, minimizing the complexity of merging base-theme updates into our customized theme. For details on how we use them, please see Dynamic Content Rendering on Stencil Storefronts."

                        ## Webpack, jspm, or Other JavaScript Managers


                        Stencil themes are Node.js applications, and therefore
                        contain dependencies on other JavaScript libraries. For
                        Stencil's default Cornerstone theme, we provide the
                        [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) build manager
                        to handle these dependencies. 


                        As you develop a theme based on Cornerstone, you have
                        options to reconfigure Webpack's watched folders, and to
                        even substitute a different build system. These options
                        are explained below.


                        All themes currently in the BigCommerce Theme
                        Marketplace use Webpack. However, older versions of
                        certain themes used the jspm JavaScript dependency
                        manager instead of Webpack. Please see this page to
                        determine (by version number) whether you are developing
                        based on one of these earlier versions, and to find the
                        required jspm setup procedures.

                        The following Webpack configuration options can aid in
                        troubleshooting.


                        ### More-Verbose JavaScript Diagnostics


                        If JavaScript errors in your browser's developer tools
                        are not reporting filenames and line numbers, try
                        changing your `webpack.conf.js` file's
                        [sourcemap](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#devtool)
                        entry from:


                        ```

                        devtool: 'source-map'

                        ```

                        to:


                        ```

                        devtool: 'eval-source-map'

                        ```


                        The `eval-source-map` option is slower, but more
                        verbose. This [Webpack Devtool
                        Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
                        article provides an overview of all devtool options and
                        details regarding each.



                        ## Build-System Configuration File


                        To take advantage of automatic JavaScript bundling and
                        browser refresh, Stencil themes require the
                        [`stencil.conf.js`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/stencil.conf.js)
                        file. To enable a custom build system, you would need to
                        edit this file.


                        Within `stencil.conf.js`, Stencil CLI looks for the
                        exported `watchOptions` object, and `development` and
                        `production` callbacks, shown below. 


                        Let's take a closer look at each of these three
                        references.


                        ## Watched Folders: watchOptions Object


                        The `watchOptions` object defines directories for the
                        [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/docs) preview
                        engine to watch or ignore, in two respective lists. You
                        are free to edit these lists:


                        ```

                        /**
                         * Watch options for the core watcher
                         * @type {{files: string[], ignored: string[]}}
                         */
                        var watchOptions = {
                            // If files in these directories change, reload the page.
                            files: [
                                '/templates',
                                '/lang'
                            ],

                            //Do not watch files in these directories
                             ignored: [
                                '/assets/scss',
                                '/assets/less',
                                '/assets/css',
                                '/assets/dist',
                            ]
                        };

                        ```


                        ## JavaScript Rebundling: development Function


                        Upon the command-line instruction `stencil start`,
                        Stencil CLI will look for and call the `development`
                        function. 


                        In the base Cornerstone theme, we have created a Webpack
                        watcher to trigger a browser reload whenever theme edits
                        cause JavaScript to be rebundled to the theme's
                        `bundle.js` file. This watcher uses options configured
                        in the webpack.conf.js file passed by `webpackConfig`.
                        So a JavaScript rebuild will refresh the browser:


                        ```

                        function development() {
                            webpack(webpackConfig).watch({}, err => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                }

                                process.send('reload');
                            });
                        }

                        ```


                        ## Theme Packaging: production Function 


                        When you issue the command-line instruction `stencil
                        bundle`, to process and package a completed theme for
                        upload to a store, Stencil CLI will look for and call
                        the `production` function. This function passes a
                        callback as its first argument, to support asynchronous
                        builds. 


                        The callback must be invoked somewhere inside the
                        `production` function, to notify Stencil CLI that the
                        theme-specific build has completed and is ready to
                        package:


                        ```

                        function production() {
                            webpackConfig.watch = false;
                            webpackConfig.devtool = false;
                            webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
                                minimize: true,
                            }));
                            webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
                                comments: false,
                                compress: {
                                    warnings: true,
                                },
                                sourceMap: false, // Toggle to turn on source maps.
                            }));

                            webpack(webpackConfig).run(err => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                    throw err;
                                }

                                process.send('done');
                            });
                        }


                        if (process.send) {
                            // running as a forked worker
                            process.on('message', message => {
                                if (message === 'development') {
                                    development();
                                }

                                if (message === 'production') {
                                    production();
                                }
                            });

                            process.send('ready');
                        }

                        theme will expose.


                        The config.json file's key/value pairs define:

                        * Global, theme-wide variables

                        * Theme variations

                        * Variation-specific variables


                        The schema.json file specifies which theme settings will
                        be accessible through the Theme Editor GUI. Your entries
                        here also define the graphical controls presented to
                        merchants for each setting.

                        _Block helper that returns the item at the specified
                        index._


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `idx` {Number}

                        * `returns` {any} `value`


                        #### {{itemAt}} Example


                        Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:


                        ```

                        {{itemAt array 1}}

                        //=> 'b'


                        ```

                        ---


                        ## {{join}}


                        The `join` helper is custom to Stencil. It joins an
                        array of string items, with separators. It returns a
                        string. 


                        #### Parameters


                        - `values`: {Array}

                        - `separator`: {String}

                        - `limit=<number>`: An optional limit.


                        #### {{join}} Example

                        ---


                        ### {{limit}}


                        The `limit` helper is custom to Stencil. It limits the
                        number of items returned from an array variable, and
                        returns a new array.


                        #### Parameters


                        - `data`: {Array}

                        - `limit`: {Number}


                        #### {{limit}} Example 


                        Assume that `{{cart.items}}` would return 10 items. You
                        could use this helper to limit that behavior to only the
                        first four items, by specifying: 


                        ```

                        {{limit cart.items 4}}

                        ```


                        ---


                        ### {{pluck}}


                        The `pluck` helper is custom to Stencil. For one or more
                        specified search key(s), it retrieves corresponding
                        values from some or all elements in a specified
                        collection. 


                        The `pluck` helper returns the retrieved values in a
                        comma-separated string. This helper's general form is:


                        ```

                        {{pluck ([limit] <collection> [<limit-value>])
                        '<search-key>'}}

                        ```


                        #### Parameters


                        - `limit`, `limit-value`: Optional parameters to limit
                        the number of results returned.

                        - `collection`: The collection to search.

                        - `search-key`: The string to search for.



                        #### {{pluck}} Example 1


                        Assume that the `categories` collection contains:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware" },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'name'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return:


                        ```

                        "Bakeware,Cookware"

                        ```


                        #### {{pluck}} Example 2


                        If the `categories` themselves each contained an image
                        object, then you could use dot notation to access that
                        image object's children:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware", "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Bakeware image"} },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cookware image"} },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cutlery image"} }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'image.data'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return a comma-separated list of image URLs.

            ## What is Stencil?


            Stencil is the theming engine for the BigCommerce platform. Stencil
            is the engine for the BigCommerce Cornerstone theme, which is the
            foundation a theme developer needs to quickly start developing
            premium, custom themes with Stencil. 


            Stencil also provides features that allow merchants to customize
            their storefront's look and feel with no coding, making Stencil a
            powerful and useful engine for all audiences.

            ## Stencil Development Features and Technology Stack


            Stencil's provides the following features, allowing BigCommerce
            theme developers to create beautiful, dynamic, and powerful
            storefronts.


            ---


            **Stencil Command Line Interface (Stencil CLI)**


            The Stencil CLI enables developers to locally develop and customize
            on any Stencil theme with no impact on a merchant's live storefront
            during the development process. When locally developing, you will
            have access to real-time Browsersync preview and testing across
            desktop, mobile, and tablet devices/viewports.


            Stencil CLI runs on the Node.js runtime environment. Installing
            Node.js also provides the required npm package manager.


            ---

            **Logic-Based Templates** 


            Stencil's logic based templates allow BigCommerce developers to
            customize storefront pages efficiently with the lightweight
            templating languge, Handlebars.js.  Handlebars allows you to
            efficiently embed dynamic and conditional logic onto your storefront
            pages.


            ---


            **Sass/SCSS Support**


            Stencils Sass and SCSS support allows developers to nest properties,
            variables, and mixins. Use the familiar Foundation framework
            (provided) or substitute your choice of framework.


            Stencil's Cornerstone base theme uses a BigCommerce pattern library
            called Citadel, which is built on top of the ZURB Foundation
            framework, version 5.5.3. Stencil does not support Foundation 6.x,
            due to breaking changes introduced between versions 5.x and 6.x.


            Foundation offers the framework for creating a responsive theme. You
            have the option of swapping out Foundation for another framework,
            although doing so would require significant work.


            Foundation assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these
            subdirectories: 


            * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/foundation/ `

            * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/foundation/`


            Citadel extends Foundation’s mixins and components to provide
            Stencil’s own mixins, extensible components, and utilities. These
            include drop-down lists, forms, and similar resources. Citadel
            resources are named according to BEM and SUIT CSS conventions.
            Classes are named functionally, rather than based on visual
            presentation or content. Our style guide is published here.

            Citadel assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these
            Cornerstone subdirectories: 


            * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/citadel/`

            * `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/citadel/`


            More detailed information about the Citadel and Foundation SCSS
            components, and their naming conventions will be covered in
            *Components and Design Patterns*.


            ---


            **Page-specific Resource Definition**


            Specify the dynamic content you want to be displayed on your
            storefront pages with YAML formatted front matter.


            ---


            **Javascript Event Hooks**


            Your Stencil themes can access remote objects through event hooks,
            using the hooks to trigger defined events based on shopper behavior.
            This will allow you to collect product data and optimize a shopper's
            experience.


            To facilitate theme-building, BigCommerce provides the stencil-utils
            client-side JavaScript library for managing event hooks.


            ---


            **Stencil Theme Editor**


            The Stencil Theme Editor is a browser-based tool that enables
            merchants to rapidly customize a theme's look and feel with no
            coding. 


            BigCommerce theme developers' configuration choices determine which
            theme aspects merchants can customize, and the range of choices for
            each aspect.


            Stencil's Theme Editor graphical interface enables merchants and
            store administrators to make styling changes to the theme currently
            applied to their storefront. 


            As a theme developer, you have the capability to define which style
            settings appear in the Stencil Theme Editor. You can grant access to
            colors, fonts, display/hiding of page features, and number of
            products/entries to display per feature.


            ---


            **Stencil Theme Variations**


            Each Stencil theme can contain one to four variations. You can
            optimize individual variations for specific markets, audiences and
            styles – while still managing and distributing all of these
            variations as one theme.

            Cornerstone comes with 3 variations: Cornerstone Light, Cornerstone
            Warm, and Cornerstone Bold.


            ---


            **Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Themes**


            BigCommerce stores powered by Stencil allow shoppers to have a first
            class experience across any device.


            ---


            This is simply a summary Stencil's core features. Continue reading
            through the Stencil Developer Documentation to learn about Stencil's
            full capabilities.

                              ## Advantages of V3 over V2


                              The V3 API introduces a number of improvements
                              designed to improve efficiency. Most tasks can be
                              performed with fewer API calls, and the V3 API
                              supports the inclusion of subresources within a
                              request. For example, you can now create a product
                              with variants and custom fields in a single API
                              call.


                              Each V3 resource includes a `meta` object at the
                              end of the response, making pagination easier.


                              Additionally, metafields have been added to the V3
                              Products resource so data can be stored against
                              the object. Metafield values can be specific to
                              your application or visible to other applications.


                              Lastly, the V3 API has been optimized for
                              performance, allowing data to be synced quickly.

                              ### Variants


                              Every purchasable entity in the catalog is now a
                              variant, including the product itself. This
                              enables enhanced flows around inventory
                              management, such as the ability to solely use the
                              variants endpoint to manage inventory levels. For
                              more on variants see
                              [Variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variant-options).


                              In V3 a variant needs to be created for every
                              combination of option values. In V2 it was
                              possible to create a SKU with a subset of product
                              options.


                              We recommend creating products using V3 as
                              BigCommerce starts to move operations to the V3
                              API. 


                              ### Interoperability between V2 and V3


                              When a product option is created in V2 and
                              assigned to a product, trying to edit the option
                              using the V3 API returns a 422 error. 


                              ```

                              {
                                  "status": 422,
                                  "title": "The product is currently associated with an option set, please remove it before editing an option or modifier.",
                                  "type": "https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api#api-status-codes",
                                  "errors": {
                                      "product_id": "The product is currently associated with an option set, please remove it before editing an option or modifier."
                                  }
                              }

                              ```


                              This happens because in V2, options are created
                              globally before being assigned to products. In V3,
                              variant options are assigned at the product level.
                              The way to fix this error is to remove the option
                              set in the control panel or delete it using the
                              API, then re-create the options using V3
                              variants. 


                              ### Options and Modifiers


                              There is now a clear separation of [options that
                              define
                              variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variant-options)
                              versus [options that are modifiers of a
                              variant](/api-docs/catalog/products/modifier-options).
                              This simplifies the creation and management of
                              variant prices and modifier adjusters and removes
                              the need to use complex rules, in all but the most
                              extreme cases.


                              In V3, options and modifiers are attached directly
                              to the product, without the requirement to create
                              an option set beforehand.


                              Creating Options on V2 has several steps:

                              1. Create the product

                              2. Create the options

                              3. Create an option set

                              4. Assign the option set to the product

                              5. Create adjustments, such as price adjustment,
                              using rules


                              Creating Products and Variants on V3:

                              1. Create the product with variants in one call

                              2. Create adjustments, such as price adjustment,
                              directly on the variant or modifier


                              Variants can be included with a GET request to
                              lower the number of API calls being made using
                              `?include=variants`.


                              V3 includes an endpoint for creating a [Catalog
                              Tree](/api-docs/api-reference/v3-api/catalog/getcatalogsummary).
                            header:
                              anchor: products-v3
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## What's not in V3


                              In V3, options are attached directly to products.
                              So option sets are not required, and v3 includes
                              no endpoint to manage option sets. However, V3
                              will respect option sets that have been attached
                              via V2 or the control panel.


                              Moving forward, new resources will be built in V3
                              and existing V2 resources will eventually be
                              migrated to V3. Some V3 resources do not have V2
                              counterparts, and vice versa. 


                              ### Complex Rules


                              Most of the use cases for using V2 rules can be
                              solved by making adjustments directly on variants
                              and modifier options. We recommend using variants
                              as best practice, but in cases where an adjustment
                              depends on the selection of multiple modifier
                              values, V3 includes a Complex Rules resource.


                              ### Product Rules 

                              Any variant created in v3 with non-null core
                              properties (price, weight, image, purchasability)
                              will create a rule under the hood. The same goes
                              for modifier adjusters. These will show in v2 as
                              product rules, and any edits to them will be
                              shared across API versions.


                              ### Option Sets

                              In our control panel’s Add/Edit Product section,
                              any products created by the V3 API will not have
                              an option set applied, but merchants can still
                              edit the options. If the merchant applies an
                              option set to a V3 product, the product's variants
                              will be removed. Currently, the Add/Edit Product
                              area consumes the V2 API, so products created and
                              managed through the control panel will be
                              converted to the V2 model, using option sets.

                              ## Recommendations

                              When the resource is available in V3, it is best
                              practice to use the V3 endpoint. For resources
                              that do not have a V3 counterpart, like Orders,
                              use V2. Both the V2 and V3 APIs authenticate with
                              Oauth and are designed to be used concurrently
                              within a single application.


                              We have created a handy [cheat sheet]() that lists
                              all the differences between V2 and V3 of the API. 
                            header:

                              ## V3 and V3 Cheat Sheet


                              This identifies the differences between major
                              actions on both versions.

                              variants, modifiers or options.

                              * Complex Products are defined as having variants,
                              options and modifiers.

                                                            When using the V2 Products API to make
                                                            product options and option sets. The
                                                            simplest workflow is when starting from
                                                            scratch is below:


                                                            1. Create an Option (in this example
                                                            Size)

                                                            2. Add option values

                                                            3. Add the options created in step 1 to
                                                            the option set

                                                            4. Create an Option Set

                                                            5. Add options created in step 1 and
                                                            step 2 to the option set.

                                                            6. Assign the option set to the product

                                                            7. Assign SKU's to the Options on the
                                                            product

                                                            This will only create an option with no
                                                            values added.

                                                            This will add values such as small,
                                                            medium and large. Only one value at a
                                                            time can be created. In this example it
                                                            will take 3 seperate /POST requests to

                              ## What are OAuth Credentials?


                              BigCommerce uses [OAuth
                              authentication](https://dev.to/anabella/dancing-with-oauth-emp)
                              for all API and app usage. Currently, there are
                              two types of tokens available, with different use
                              cases. 


                              ### API Credentials

                              Credentials for making API requests are created in
                              the Control Panel and can only be created by the
                              store owner. They are referred to in this
                              documentation as API Credentials. API Credentials
                              are used for testing, webhooks and writing
                              scripts. The API Credentials can only be created
                              by the store owner since they are tied to the
                              store.


                              ### Client Id and Client Token

                              Credentials for creating apps for sale in the
                              marketplace, private apps or connector apps are
                              created in DevTools. They are referred to as
                              Client Id and Client Token in this documentation. 
                              The Client Id and Client Token are used for
                              generating an authorization token per store. This
                              eliminates the need to have a merchant generate
                              new API Credentials every time they want to
                              install an app in their store.

                              ## Getting API Credentials

                              You can create and manage API Credentials in the
                              BigCommerce control panel by creating an API
                              account, as described below. (Only the store owner
                              can create API accounts; accounts are limited to
                              50 per store.)


                              To create your API account and its corresponding
                              token, use the following steps:

                              1. Log into the store, using the store owner’s
                              username/password.

                              2. Select Advanced Settings.

                              3. Select API Accounts. This will display the
                              Store API Accounts page.

                              4. Select Create API Account. This will display
                              the Create API Account page shown above.

                              5. In the Name field, summarize the purpose for
                              which you will use these credentials. (This name
                              is for internal use only, so assign any name that
                              you will recognize.)

                              6. In the OAuth Scopes section, select at least
                              the minimal scopes your app will require.

                              7. Select Save at the page’s lower right-hand
                              corner.


                              A successful save will display a pop-up,
                              containing the API credentials that your app will
                              need to run authenticated requests – your Client
                              ID and Access Token. A .txt file containing the
                              same credentials will (on most browsers)
                              automatically download to your computer. This file
                              also contains the base API Path for your store,
                              preconfigured for the v3 API.


                              From a security perspective, these credentials are
                              sensitive – please treat them with the same
                              caution that you would treat a private key or root
                              password.


                              To get started making requests, see [API
                              Requests]().

                                So make sure you store your credentials – either
                                by copying/pasting the contents of each field
                                out of the pop-up or by keeping the downloaded
                                .txt file. Otherwise, you will need to repeat
                                all the above steps to generate new
                                credentials.

                              To revoke an OAuth token, use the following steps
                              to delete the associated API account:

                              1. Log into the store, using the store owner’s
                              username/password.

                              2. Select Advanced Settings.

                              3. Select API Accounts. This will display the
                              Store API Accounts page, shown below.

                              4. In the Actions column at right, select the
                              trash-can button next to the account you want to
                              delete.

                              ## Getting Client ID and Client Secret


                              * The Client ID value uniquely identifies your app
                              and you will need to pass it in the header of all
                              your requests to the Stores API.

                              * The Client Secret value is a secret that your
                              app and BigCommerce share. You do need to pass the
                              Client Secret value more than once during the app
                              installation sequence. Thereafter, BigCommerce
                              uses it to sign payloads in load, uninstall, and
                              remove user requests, and your app uses it to
                              verify the signature to ensure that the request is
                              coming from BigCommerce.


                              To get a Client ID and Client Secret you will need
                              to log in to the developer portal. 


                              1. Click on Create an app.

                              2. Give your app a name. This will only be visible
                              to you.

                              3. A pop up box will display showing Your Profile,
                              App Summary and Category.

                              5. Then in the lower right-hand corner of the
                              popup box click Update & Close.

                              6. A new pop up will show asking if you want to
                              change the OAuth Scopes. Click Confirm Update.

                              7. It will take you back to the home page and your
                              app will be listed. Click View Client ID.

                                As of July 31, 2018, new BigCommerce stores are
                                no longer able to create Legacy API Accounts
                                (accounts using HTTP Basic Auth) within their
                                control panels. Existing Legacy API Accounts
                                will continue to work until further notice, but
                                we strongly recommend migrating to OAuth as soon
                                as possible.
                          - type: text
                            data: "### Migrating to OAuth comes with several benefits:\n\n* All OAuth requests are sent to a common hostname: `https://api.bigcommerce.com`. Using a single hostname prevents any interruption of service when the domain or SSL on a particular store changes or expires.\n\n* All of BigCommerce’s newest V3 APIs are exclusively available via OAuth.\n\n* OAuth API accounts have access to subscribe to BigCommerce’s Webhooks for real-time event notifications\n\n* The ability to use new APIs that require a shared secret, such as the Storefront Login API or the Storefront Current Customer identification endpoint.\n\n* Gzip compression on API responses to reduce bandwidth usage\n\n* Better security as all OAuth tokens are scoped to particular endpoints\n\n### How to Migrate\n\nFirst, consider whether your application should reside within the public App Marketplace, where any BigCommerce merchant can quickly discover and install it. To learn more about how to set up this kind of app, see [Becoming a Partner](/api-docs/getting-started/partner/becoming-a-partner).\n\nIf you would like to update your API connection from Basic Authentication to OAuth, you will need to make the following changes:\n\n- Get a Client ID and an Access Token, by creating an API Account within the control panel. You’ll want to make sure the account has the correct Scopes for the API endpoints you need to access. We recommend that you provide the minimum scopes that your application requires to function, as a good security practice.\n- If you use one of the Client Libraries, follow the relevant guide (within the library’s documentation) for establishing an OAuth connection.\n- If you have created your connection, you’ll want to update your connection parameters:\n\t- Where you previously used the BigCommerce store’s secure hostname, you will instead use the `https://api.bigcommerce.com` gateway URL.\nAs an example, requests to `https://store-abc123.mybigcommerce.com/api/v2/orders/123` or `https://my-custom-store-domain.com/api/v2/orders/123 `would instead go to `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v2/orders/123`.\n- With Basic Auth, you use an Authentication HTTP Header to authenticate your connection. With OAuth, you’ll want to use two headers:\n\t- X-Client-Id for your Client ID, and the \n\t- X-Auth-Token header for your Access Token. You can read more here.\n\nRate limiting of API requests works differently for OAuth API connections. To become familiar with the OAuth system, please see the [Rate Limits]()."

                              accomplish the task at hand.


                              All OAuth scopes except `default` have `read_only`
                              scopes that allow only `GET` and `HEAD` requests.

                              A media type is the format of the request or
                              response body. The BigCommerce API accepts
                              requests and responds in JSON. You should encode
                              requests using the UTF-8 character set. (Other
                              character sets might have unpredictable results.)

                              ### Request Content Type

                              When performing a request that contains a body
                              (eg. POST or PUT), the type of content you are
                              sending needs to be specified in the Content-Type
                              header. 


                              ### Response Content Type

                              There are two ways you can specify the type of
                              content you would like to receive. The first
                              method is to specify an Accept header. The second
                              is to supply an extension to the resource you are
                              requesting. 


                              The priority in which these methods are processed
                              are:

                              * Accept header high-priority types (eg. Accept:
                              application/json) extensions on the resource
                              (e.g.: customers.json).

                              * Accept header low priority types (priorities
                              less than 1, e.g.: Accept: application/json;q=0.9)
                            header:
                              anchor: content-types
                          - type: text
                            data: >-

                              ### Request Structure

                              The body of a JSON request is an object containing
                              a set of key-value pairs. A simple representation
                              of a product object is:


                              ```

                              {
                                   "id": 5,
                                   "name": "iPod",
                                   "description": "A portable MP3 music player."
                               } 
                              ```


                              ### Response Structure

                              Responses are structured similarly to requests. If
                              a request returns a single object, then the
                              response will contain a single object, containing
                              the fields for that resource.

                              Did you get a status of 403 Forbidden?

                              * Check the Client ID and Client Token.

                              * Check your request headers are correct.

                              * Check to see if you replaced `{store_hash}` with
                              your store hash. 

                              * Make sure the request url is correct.


                              Did you get a 200 but nothing was returned?

                              * Make sure your store has products.


                              Did you get a status of 404?

                              * Check the request url for errors.

                              BigCommerce frequently enhances its core product
                              and is actively developing v3 API endpoints. By
                              using the newest API version, you will ensure that
                              your app has access to the latest resources. You
                              will also be better positioned to provide a user
                              experience consistent with what merchants will see
                              in their BigCommerce store’s control panel. To
                              stay up to date bookmark our

                              ## Use Webhooks Effectively Within Your
                              Application


                              To keep data in your application up-to-date,
                              webhooks provide a great alternative to doing
                              periodic checks. In order to register a webhook
                              event that your application can listen for, you
                              will need to use OAuth (not legacy “Basic
                              Authentication”).


                              BigCommerce will send a partial payload when a
                              subscribed event is triggered, with minimal
                              identifying details (such as the order ID when an
                              order is created). Your application could use the
                              order ID returned in the payload to make a
                              subsequent API request for the full order
                              details..
                            header:

                              ## Thread Your Requests to the BigCommerce API


                              In order to quickly update information in the API,
                              you can use threaded requests. Threaded requests
                              allow you to send multiple requests at one time.
                              They can come from a different open connection or
                              multiple requests to the same resource. 


                              The [BigCommerce Ruby API](http://) client is
                              thread-safe: It satisfies the need for multiple
                              threads to access the same shared data, and the
                              need for a shared piece of data to be accessed by
                              only one thread at any given time. These
                              attributes can reduce the total time that your app
                              will require to complete a series of requests.

                              ## Marketplace Apps


                              Merchants often have more than one person working
                              on their store. BigCommerce allows additional
                              users to access your app when the store owner has
                              granted them appropriate permissions. The
                              requirements for supporting multi-user access are:

                              * Tokens must be stored against the store_hash and
                              not against user info.

                              * Within Developer Portal > My Apps, you must
                              enable the app’s Technical > Multiple Users
                              option.


                              In the payload returned when a user launches an
                              app, users are distinguished by `owner_email`
                              versus `user_email`. If these two emails match,
                              the user is the store owner.


                              If you wish to enable user removal, you can do by
                              filling in the app’s Technical > Remove User
                              Callback URL field. (Enabling user removal is
                              optional.)

                              For more advanced implementations, you can enable
                              the store owner to grant specific permissions to
                              different non-admin users. For example,
                              person1@email.com could be restricted to editing
                              product inventory but not seeing orders. If you
                              decide to include this feature in your app, it’s a
                              great feature to advertise.

                              ## Rate Limits

                              Apps that authenticate with OAuth are
                              rate-limited, based on a quota that is refreshed
                              every few seconds. The maximum quota for a store
                              will vary depending on the store’s plan.


                              * Enterprise plans and Enterprise Sandboxes
                              (Enterprise-Test): Unlimited (7mil / 30sec)

                              * Pro plans: 80k per hour (450 / 30sec)

                              * All other sandboxes (Dev/Partner/Employee): 20k
                              per hour (150 / 30sec)

                              * Plus & Standard plans: 20k per hour (150 /
                              30sec)


                              Each request to the API consumes one available
                              request from the quota. When an app hits the quota
                              limit, subsequent requests are rejected until the
                              quota is refreshed.


                              The store’s overall quota is distributed across
                              all apps that are accessing the store at a given
                              time. This provides fairness for multiple apps
                              that are accessing the API simultaneously,
                              preventing a single greedy app from consuming the
                              store’s entire quota by itself. The quota might
                              adjust as additional clients connect or disconnect
                              while you’re running requests.

                              | X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms | Shows how many
                              milliseconds are remaining in the window. In this
                              case, 3000 milliseconds – so, 3000 milliseconds
                              after this request, the API quota will be
                              refreshed. |

                              | X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota | Shows how many API
                              requests are allowed in the current window for
                              your client. In this case, the number is 25
                              requests. |

                              | X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left | Details how many
                              remaining requests your client can make in the
                              current window before being rate-limited. In this
                              case, you would expect to be able to make 6 more
                              requests in the next 3000 milliseconds; on the 7th
                              request within 3000 milliseconds, you would be
                              rate-limited and would receive an HTTP 429
                              response.|


                              If your request to the API triggers a [429 Too
                              Many Requests](http://) response, then you know
                              you’ve been limited.


                              The rate-limited response will contain the
                              `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header, specifying a
                              time (in milliseconds) that your client must wait
                              before its quota has refreshed. Retry the request
                              after this time has elapsed, and your API service
                              will resume as normal.

                              You might wish to increase the amount of work your
                              application can do in a given unit of time, by
                              sending multiple HTTP requests to the BigCommerce
                              API in parallel. This is perfectly acceptable.

                              However, your application should monitor the
                              rate-limiting headers to avoid an HTTP 429
                              response. Methods for doing this might include:

                              * Slowing your rate of API requests when
                              X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left is nearing zero.

                              * Determining an acceptable average rate of
                              requests, by dividing X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota
                              by X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Seconds, and then
                              self-throttling to that rate.

                              BigCommerce does have a limit on the number of
                              products, category, brands etc that can be in a
                              store. See [Platform

                              include subresources and other information in the
                              primary GET response for a parent object.


                              This allows you to save API calls by getting more
                              information in a response, however it may slow
                              down your response.


                              As an example, you can include a product's
                              variants and images with the product response:
                              `/v3/catalog/products?include=variants,images`


                              Available includes vary by endpoint. Refer to the
                              GET method for an endpoint to see a list of
                              available includes.


                              ### Including and Excluding fields


                              Some endpoints use `?include_fields` and
                              `?exclude_fields`. 


                              `include_fields` will return ONLY the specified
                              fields in the response. `exclude_fields` will omit
                              the specified fields from the response.


                              You can specify any field that is available as
                              apart of the object. Excluding fields you don't
                              care about (especially large fields like
                              descriptions) can speed up your API request
                              response time.



                              #### Example


                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products?include_fields=name,price`


                              Here product name and price have been included.


                              ```

                              {

                              |||*   Check your app in `My Apps` to review the
                              OAuth scopes you requested, and check whether they
                              support the request that you made.

                              |||*   Changes to the store owner's account
                              (including a change to the email address) can also
                              cause this error. Roll back those changes to
                              correct it.

                              |||*   This error can also occur when your request
                              exceeds a limit imposed on the resource in
                              question. For example, a store cannot exceed
                              16,000 categories. For more information, see the
                              corresponding resource's documentation.

                              | **405** | **Method Not Allowed** | The resource
                              was found, but doesn’t support the request method.
                              Issued when either a specific method isn’t yet
                              implemented on a resource, or the resource doesn’t
                              support the method at all. For example, a `PUT` on
                              `/orders` is invalid, but a `PUT` on
                              `/orders/{_id_}` is valid. |

                              | **406** | **Not Acceptable** | When the client
                              specifies a response content type in the `Accept`
                              header that is not supported. |

                              | **409** | **Conflict** | A change requested by
                              the client is being rejected, due to a condition
                              imposed by the server. The exact reasons for this
                              response will vary from one resource to the next.
                              An example might be attempting to delete a
                              category whose deletion would cause products to be
                              orphaned. Additional information about the
                              conflict, and about how to resolve it, might be

                              due to issues with the `Content-Type` header.

                              These codes are returned for requests that could
                              not be processed due to an internal error with the

Either credentials are absent from the request, or we are receiving invalid credentials. Steps to resolve this:\n\t* Double-check your Access Token and Client ID.\n\t* If your credentials are valid, try sending a cURL request with the same credentials. This will test whether the problem is something within your application, rather than a credentials issue.\n* For 403 errors , there are 4 common causes:\n\t* Your app lacks the appropriate scopes to make the request that it sent. Resolution: Check the OAuth scopes that you requested, either in control panel > API Accounts or in Developer Portal’s My Apps section.\n\t* The store-owner account has changed on a store that installed your app. Resolution: This might require a reinstall by the new store owner, or a rollback of the store-owner changes.\n\t* Your API request exceeded an enforced platform limit. Among other limits, each store is limited to a maximum of 30,000 brands and 16,000 categories. For more information about these limits, see either the API resource you are using or our support documentation on platform limits.\n* Check your URL paths. An incorrect path can sometimes trigger a 403 error.\n* 500 errors almost always indicate an internal server error on BigCommerce’s side. Steps to resolve these:\n\t* Re-attempt the request three to five times, with increasing delays of at least a minute between attempts.\n\t* Check our status page.\n\t* 500 errors can also be caused by particularly expensive API calls. To avoid these errors on stores with very complex data, try reducing how many objects you are requesting. In the v2 API, you can request fewer objects by using ?limit={count}. In either the v2 or v3 API, you can request fewer objects by excluding certain fields or only requesting certain fields.\n\t* \n### Why am I getting an HTTP 204 or 301/302 response to an API request?\n* Double-check the URL to which you are making an API request. If the response code is 301/302, try the WWW or non-WWW version of the URL."

                              to become a vendor of Single-Click Apps on the
                              BigCommerce platform. Doing so requires a
                              partnership application, but acceptance will
                              authorize you to provide best-of-breed solutions
                              to the fast-growing online businesses we host.


                              ## Apply to the Technology Partner Program


                              Before you can submit an app to the BigCommerce
                              App Marketplace (which merchants also know as our
                              “app store”), you must become an official Partner.
                              BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox
                              stores through its Technology Partner Program. To
                              be approved as a partner, you will need:


                              * A website.

                              * Intent to offer your app publicly.

                              * Ability to support users of your app.

                              * Evidence of expertise in app development.


                              Once approved, you will receive one or more emails
                              listing your partner credentials and next steps.
                              Your Partner ID will be required to submit your
                              app for App Marketplace consideration. If you do
                              not receive these credentials by email, please

                              technology that provides an outstanding user
                              experience for BigCommerce Merchants.

                              ## Getting a Sandbox Store


                              To build a Marketplace app or hidden app, you will
                              need to have a sandbox store, a developer account
                              at devtools.bigcommerce.com and be accepted as a
                              BigCommerce partner. This account is separate from
                              the account created when signing up for the store.
                              A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is
                              for developing and testing apps without the 15-day
                              time time limit of a trial store. 
                            header:

                                A sandbox store is not required for app
                                development, but after the 15-day trial period,
                                the store is erased along with the data and a
                                new store will need to be created. Applying to
                                be a partner and getting a sandbox store is best
                                practice.

                              ### Create a Sandbox Store


                              1. Navigate to the [BigCommerce Pricing
                              page](https://www.bigcommerce.com/pricing/).

                              2. Select START YOUR FREE TRIAL.

                              3. Where prompted for an email address, enter the
                              same email that you used when applying to become a
                              Technology Partner. 

                              4. Select START YOUR TRIAL.

                              5. In the trial store setup form, enter a store
                              name, password, and other details. Then select
                              CREATE YOUR STORE.

                              6. Navigate to your Partner Portal > Support >
                              Create a Case > Issue Type = Portal and
                              Membership. In the case description, enter your
                              new sandbox store’s friendly URL (for example:
                              http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and
                              request conversion to a Sandbox. We will flag this
                              as a sandbox store. This will ensure your
                              continued access to the store, as opposed to the
                              normal 15-day trial. This can take around two
                              days.

                              7. When you log into your new store, use the same
                              email that you used at step 3 above.
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'

                              ## App Store Approval Requirements


                              ### Prerequisites


                              Make sure you’ve applied and been approved for our
                              [Technology Partner
                              Program](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx)
                              before you’re ready to submit your app - you’ll
                              need a valid Partner ID to do so. You’ll also need
                              to accept the Terms & Conditions in the [Partner
                              Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/)
                              before we can publish your app.


                              ### General Requirements


                              -   Support resources should be available
                              throughout the app experience, including in your
                              onboarding flow and the app’s dashboard.
                                  
                              -   Make sure to reference BigCommerce using the
                              proper formatting. You can visit our [Media
                              Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/)
                              for any BigCommerce branding assets need.
                                  
                              -   The app and app listing should make no
                              references to competitor platforms.


                              -   Use the brand name you’ve given your app for
                              your app title throughout your app content. This
                              listing name should be a concise title for easy
                              identification and should not include additional
                              taglines or descriptors. The name will always
                              appear alongside your summary, so there’s no need
                              to muddy your app’s branding with duplicate
                              content when that tagline is already displayed
                              with it!  
                                    
                                  - If your solution is a connector to a specific third-party service, or you’re offering only a specific feature, make sure to include both the name of the third party service or feature and your company name (Ex: “Marketplace by BigCommerce”, “Search by BigCommerce”), with your company name following the feature.
                                  
                              -   Your app, including any storefront components,
                              should be compatible with all
                              [browsers](#stencil-link) that the BigCommerce
                              platform supports.


                              ### Listing Requirements

                              - Your primary app logo should be 350x130px (or
                              larger at this ratio) with a white background and
                              dark branding in the foreground. The logo should
                              only include branding, no taglines necessary.

                              - Your app icon will be included on the main app
                              detail page and the sidebar in the BigCommerce
                              control panel once the app is installed. This
                              should be a square 200x200px image.

                              - Your alternate logo will be used if your app is
                              featured on the homepage carousel of the
                              Marketplace. This image should be 259x158px (or
                              larger at this ratio) with a dark background and
                              white or light branding in the foreground. The
                              logo should only include branding, no taglines
                              necessary.
                                  
                              #### Pricing & Categorization

                              - Select one of our pre-formatted pricing options
                              to call out your app’s starting price. If you
                              offer a forever-free plan, choose the “Free”
                              option. If your app does not fit one of our
                              formatted options, specify your details in a few
                              words in the “Other” selection.

                              - Choose the most appropriate category for your
                              app.

                              its category, and why a merchant should choose you

                              ### Installation


                              -   Apps should be Single-Click and use our OAuth
                              token exchange flow to authenticate the user
                                  
                              -   Single-Click does not mean everything 
                              completed in one click, but that authentication is
                              handled in that click - other tasks can be handled
                              post-auth with the user
                                  
                              -   When the app is installed, a styled HTML page
                              must be returned in the iframe of the BigCommerce
                              control panel - this content cannot be blank and
                              must follow our [user-interface
                              constraints](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#user-interface-constraints).
                                  
                              -   During the OAuth handshake, be sure to store
                              the user’s token against their store hash - rather
                              than their email address - to avoid any problems
                              with ownership changes or multi-user support.

                                If your app cannot meet these requirements,
                                please reach out to <a
                                href="mailto:partnersupport@bigcommerce.com">partnersupport@bigcommerce.com</a>
                                in order to discuss the potential for a
                                Connector app listing. In the majority of cases,
                                a Single-Click app will be the more appropriate
                                solution and put your integration on par with
                                other Marketplace partners, but exceptions may
                                be made under certain circumstances

                              ### Functionality


                              -   Your app must work as intended, be free of
                              defects, and not conflict with or break any
                              default BigCommerce functionality, including the
                              BigCommerce storefront and checkout.
                                  
                              -   Utilize any V3 API resources that are
                              currently available for the content you need from
                              a BigCommerce store.
                                  
                              -   The dashboard and callback URLs for your app
                              should operate strictly over HTTPS using a valid
                              SSL certificate.
                                  
                              -   Apps should offer [multi-user
                              support](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#multi-user-support)
                              so that permissions for the app can be distributed
                              by the store owner to additional users, from the
                              BigCommerce control panel.
                                  
                              -   Any apps that process transactions or handle
                              credit card data will need to pass a PCI
                              Compliance review with our Security team, and also
                              be compatible with our Optimized One-Page
                              Checkout.
                                  
                              -   Avoid copy/paste for storefront code - use the
                              [V3 Scripts
                              API](/api-docs/api-reference/v3-api/content-api)
                              to programmatically inject code snippets into a
                              store’s Script Manager and storefront theme.
                                  
                              -   If your app requires payment, you’ll need to
                              collect payment from the user within your app.

                              ### Recommendations


                              -   Have a form to fill out for new users? We
                              recommend auto-filling user input fields with data
                              from the [Store Information API resource](), which
                              already contains much of the info you might need
                              from a new user.
                                  
                              -   No account approval process needed for your
                              app? Consider automatically generating accounts
                              for stores that install your app and don’t match
                              an existing store in your database.
                                  
                              -   Require login on launch? Use the information
                              in the BigCommerce payload to your callback URL to
                              authenticate the user without asking for a
                              username and password each time.
                                  
                              -   Want to share user testimonials? Add a link to
                              your full case study in the Case Studies field,
                              with a title and short description.



                              ### Technical


                              You will have already provided much of the
                              information during the initial app registration.
                              Before submitting your app, please review the
                              information that you initially provided, to make
                              sure that all of the URIs are publicly available,
                              fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL. Also,
                              ensure that your app is requesting all of the
                              scopes that it needs now, as well as the scopes
                              that you anticipate needing in the future.


                              Before submission, you must also provide detailed
                              testing instructions, as well as test accounts.

                                Changing scopes once your app is launched will
                                require all of your current users to
                                re-authorize the app before they can launch it
                                again.

                              Our submission guidelines aim to protect the
                              merchant experience and to provide enough
                              structure for you to develop apps efficiently and
                              effectively. Before submitting your app, please be
                              sure to carefully review the App Requirements, to
                              avoid having your app rejected and going through
                              resubmission. A fee of $99 is required for each
                              submission. If the app is rejected you will be
                              charged for a new submission. You can submit an
                              app through the [Dev
                              Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com).

                                
                              ###  Monetizing Your App


                              If you want to charge merchants for your app,
                              please note that BigCommerce expects you to handle
                              the billing aspects of the transaction. Your app
                              needs to take care of collecting the fee from the
                              merchant.


                              Under BigCommerce’s Technology Partner Program,
                              within 30 days of collecting this revenue, you
                              must send BigCommerce 20% and retain the remaining
                              80% for yourself. Once your app is published, a
                              mandatory revenue-share reporting form will be
                              sent to the primary contact on your partner
                              account, at the beginning of each month.

                              ##  Troubleshooting


                              ### Are all fields required?


                              While not all fields are required to publish edits
                              for your listing, they are all highly recommended.
                              Without filling in all fields, your listing will
                              be missing information that merchants have seen on
                              other listings and expect to see throughout the
                              Marketplace.


                              ###  I’ve logged in to the Developer Portal, but I
                              don’t see my published listing. Where is it?


                              You may be logged in with the wrong account. Each
                              listing can only be owned by one user, so it is
                              likely assigned to another email address. If
                              you’re unable to track down the correct owner
                              account for your solution, please reach out to <a
                              href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.


                              ### I saved my changes, but my listing detail page
                              on BigCommerce.com/Apps has not updated yet.
                              What’s the problem?


                              The changes will be effective immediately in your
                              control panel app card, but the updates can take
                              up to 24 hours to appear on the public BigCommerce
                              Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace
                              period to make additional edits as needed.

                                        when applying for your Partner Id. 


                                        ### Partner Name

                                        List the name of your company​, as you
                                        want it to be attributed on the detail
                                        page.


                                        ### Partner Website

                                        Provide the URL for your homepage so
                                        users can learn more about your company.


                                        ### Support email

                                        Email where users can get help with the
                                        app. This should be a formal group email
                                        at your company domain (Ex:
                                        support@app-partner.com) rather than a
                                        personal email. If not provided, this
                                        option will not be displayed.


                                        ### Support website

                                        A Support email and website for users to
                                        reach out as needed.

                                        These will be publicly visible on the
                                        Marketplace, so make sure to stay away
                                        from personal emails or non-support
                                        URLs. Your public detail page will
                                        include a button for users to “Get
                                        Support,” which will take them to this
                                        URL in a new tab. If not provided, the
                                        button will not be displayed on your
                                        detail page.


                                        ### Partner ID

                                        When you’re ready to submit your listing
                                        for review, you will need to enter your
                                        [Partner
                                        ID](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx)
                                        for your Technology Partner account.

                                        ### App Name

                                        Use the brand name you’ve given your app
                                        for your app title throughout your app
                                        content. This listing name should be a
                                        concise title for easy identification
                                        and should not include additional
                                        taglines or descriptors. The name will
                                        always appear alongside your summary, so
                                        there’s no need to muddy your app’s
                                        branding with duplicate content when
                                        that tagline is already displayed with
                                        it.

                                          offering only a particular feature, make
                                          sure to include both the name of the
                                          third party service or feature and your
                                          company name​ (Ex: “Marketplace by
                                          BigCommerce,” “Search by BigCommerce”).
                                          The company name needs to follow the
                                          feature.

                                        Your primary app logo should be 350 x
                                        130px (or larger at this ratio) with a
                                        white background and dark branding in
                                        the foreground. The logo should only
                                        include branding, no taglines necessary.


                                        ### Price

                                        price. If you offer a forever-free plan,
                                        choose the “Free” option. If your app
                                        does not fit one of our options, specify
                                        your details in a few words in the
                                        “Other” selection.

                                        A short tagline description of your app
                                        that will be used on your app card in
                                        category and search results within the
                                        Marketplace. 128 characters max.


                                        ### App Icon

                                        Your app icon will be included on the
                                        main app detail page and the sidebar in
                                        the BigCommerce control panel once the
                                        app is installed. This should be a
                                        square 200 x 200px image.


                                        ### Category

                                        Choose the most appropriate category for
                                        your app. Take a look at the live
                                        [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)
                                        for an idea of where solutions are
                                        currently assigned to help decide the
                                        right category. The category selection
                                        will also be a search attribute for your
                                        listing. BigCommerce will review your
                                        category assignment and may
                                        re-categorize your listing prior to
                                        launch. One category maximum.

                                        A more in-depth value proposition for
                                        your listing, including how your
                                        solution works, why your solution stands
                                        out in its category, and why a merchant
                                        should choose you over other
                                        competitors. Avoid using fluff or
                                        buzzwords, as this field will not be
                                        indexed for search. 200 words max
                                        recommended.


                                        ### Videos

                                        Include videos that highlight the
                                        purpose and value of your solution.
                                        Select the video hosting platform
                                        (YouTube or Vimeo) and enter the video
                                        ID.

                                        Per Vimeo’s guidelines, businesses may
                                        not use Basic or Plus accounts to host
                                        videos. If you want to upload commercial
                                        videos, you must use Vimeo PRO or
                                        Business. Commercial content includes:


                                        Videos promoting or representing a
                                        for-profit business or brand

                                        (i.e., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on
                                        your company’s website) 

                                        Product demos and tutorials

                                        Use these fields to enumerate the major
                                        features your platform or solution has
                                        to offer. Include a brief title for each
                                        feature, and a description of the
                                        feature to accompany it. The feature
                                        title will be search indexed in the
                                        Marketplace, so be specific with your
                                        feature names and include major
                                        functions potential users will search
                                        for. Use the + icon to add a feature,
                                        and the x icon to remove. Utilize the
                                        rich text editing of these fields to

                                        needed. 

                                        Up to five features can be added.

                                        Guides as a reference for existing users

                                        We now ask that you include links to
                                        your solution’s user installation guide
                                        (PDF, support articles, etc.) and

                                        ### Alternate Logo

                                        Your alternate logo will be used if your
                                        app is featured on the homepage carousel
                                        of the Marketplace. This image should be

                                        with a dark background and white or
                                        light branding in the foreground. The
                                        logo should only include branding, no
                                        taglines necessary.

                                        By default, your app will only be
                                        accessible to the store owner (i.e., the
                                        user who created the store). Optionally,
                                        you can allow your app to be accessible
                                        to other store users. Consider the
                                        following before enabling [multi-user
                                        support](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#multi-user-support):


                                        -   Once you enable multi-user support,
                                        a store admin will still need to grant
                                        access to other users from within the
                                        store control panel. For each user
                                        account, there are settings that grant
                                        access to specific apps.
                                            
                                        -   Your app should be aware that when
                                        it receives the [Load
                                        Callback](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests),
                                        the user information passed in might not
                                        be the store owner’s. You’ll need to
                                        determine how to respond if you see a
                                        different user. For example, you may
                                        want to provision a new user account in
                                        order to personalize the experience.
                                            
                                        -   You can optionally specify a [Remove
                                        User Callback
                                        URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests)
                                        to receive a callback when a store admin
                                        revokes a user’s access.

                                        Select the type of app. We recommend

                                        You must have an [Auth Callback

                                        and a [Load Callback
                                        URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#installation-update-sequence)
                                        to register your app.


                                        #### Public URIs Required before
                                        Submission


                                        Because the Auth Callback URI and Load
                                        Callback URI requests originate from the
                                        browser and not from BigCommerce, you
                                        can use non–publicly-available URIs and
                                        a self-signed certificate for a quick
                                        start. However, you must switch to – and
                                        test your app with – a publicly
                                        available Auth Callback URI and Load
                                        Callback URI before submitting your app
                                        for consideration in the App
                                        Marketplace.


                                        If you want to receive a callback when
                                        the store owner uninstalls your app, you
                                        can provide an [Uninstall Callback
                                        URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests).

                                        If you know the [OAuth
                                        scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/authentication#oauth-scopes)
                                        that your app requires, you should
                                        select these. If you do not yet know the
                                        scopes that you need, you can just
                                        request minimal permissions (such as
                                        Information: Read-Only) to get started.
                                        However, once you determine the scopes
                                        you need, you must:

                                        - Modify the scopes of your app in My
                                        Apps and save the changes.

                                        - Obtain the new OAuth token during the
                                        [App Installation or Update
                                        flow](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/#app-installation-and-update-sequence).

                                        - Retest your app to make sure it still
                                        functions properly with the new token.

                              the app does not require the customer to install

                              settings for a third party service. 

                              To put an app on the Marketplace, you must first
                              be a BigCommerce partner and have your app
                              approved through the App Submission Process. After
                              becoming a partner and having the app approved you
                              have the option of charging merchants to use the
                              app. 


                              For a Single-Click App, you will need a Client ID
                              and Client Secret from the Developer Portal.

                              An OAuth token is obtained in the [single-click
                              app authentication flow. ](http://)

                              In some cases, you might want to create an API
                              Account in your store’s control panel, as the
                              fastest way to establish an API connection to an
                              individual store and to start running requests. 


                              Use Cases:

                              - You are not creating an application for
                              distribution in the BigCommerce App Marketplace.

                              - You are testing your app before submission, and
                              it doesn’t need to be distributed to other stores.


                              For Private Apps you need Client ID and Client
                              Secret from the [Developer Portal](http://). Also
                              a OAuth token from the store’s [control
                              panel](http://) or you can request a token during
                              the installation flow.

                              [Approved partners](http://) have the option of
                              uploading “hidden” apps to the App Marketplace. A
                              hidden app is a published app that does not show
                              up in the public BigCommerce marketplace. To
                              create a hidden app you need to be a BigCommerce
                              Partner. 

                              Use Cases:

                              A partner is beta-testing an integration before a
                              full Marketplace launch.

                              A BigCommerce user with several stores wants to
                              install a custom app on all of them. Submitting a
                              hidden app offers a streamlined alternative to
                              creating a separate draft or test apps for each
                              store.

                              To have an app hidden, please contact <a

                              ## Scripts


                              You can write a script to test an endpoint, check
                              small portions of app code you are writing, or to
                              create an application that will not be distributed
                              in the BigCommerce Marketplace. Scripts do not
                              have a user interface. To get started with writing
                              scripts all you need is an API key from the
                              store’s Control Panel. Learn more about [creating

                              ## Connector and Other OAuth Apps


                              Some apps qualify to be listed in the BigCommerce
                              App Marketplace as “Connector” apps. These apps
                              use manual OAuth token creation instead of the
                              Single-Click App flow.

                              While we always recommend and prefer the
                              Single-Click App flow’s programmatic OAuth
                              exchange, certain use cases might not be
                              compatible.


                              Use Cases:

                              - Customized integrations that vary per store.

                              - Integrations that do not provide any content for
                              an iframe.

                              - Apps that do not provide Web services for OAuth
                              exchange. (For example: offline sync apps.)

                              - Apps that do not provide Web or cloud-hosted
                              components for a dashboard.
                            header:
                              anchor: connector
                          - type: callout
                            data:

                                Manual OAuth tokens require the store owner to
                                create an API Token in the Control Panel and
                                then pass those values into the app manually.
                                The single click installation process is
                                preferred since it does not require this step.

                              To create a Connector app that uses manual OAuth
                              token creation, make the following selections on
                              the My Apps Create/Edit flow’s 


                              Technical tab:

                              1. Set the App Type option to Connector.

                              2. Enter your app’s Signup URL. This is the URL
                              where a user would begin to configure the
                              connection between your service and the
                              BigCommerce store.

                              4. Under OAuth scopes, select the scopes that your
                              app requires for BigCommerce review only. Later,
                              you will need to instruct store users to create a
                              token with the production scopes your app needs.


                              BigCommerce must review and approve your Connector
                              app proposal before we will accept the app’s
                              submission to the Marketplace. 


                              If you’re interested in submitting your
                              integration as a Connector app, please contact out

                              Public API requests are authenticated by the
                              following HTTP headers:


                              ```

                              In addition, while not all resources require the
                              Accept and Content-Type headers, many do. To
                              ensure that your calls succeed, always include

                              We recommend that you add BigCommerce’s JavaScript
                              SDK to your Single-Click Apps, to protect your
                              apps’ users from getting logged out of the
                              BigCommerce control panel after a period of
                              idleness. To include our SDK, add this script tag
                              to your Single-Click App:

                              `<script
                              src="//cdn.bigcommerce.com/jssdk/bc-sdk.js">`



                              Optionally, you can pass a logout callback
                              function within the initialization call:


                              ```

                              Bigcommerce.init({
                                    onLogout: callback
                              });

                              ```



                              This callback function will run when the user
                              explicitly logs out of the BigCommerce control
                              panel, or is automatically logged out. The
                              callback will allow your app to respond to this
                              logout.
                            header:

                              The purpose of the App Installation sequence is to
                              obtain an Oauth token for the store installing the
                              app, using the Client ID and Secret from Dev
                              Tools. 


                              A user at a store’s control panel kicks off the
                              installation or update sequence by clicking the
                              “Install” button from your app details page, or by
                              clicking an installed app to update its scopes.
                              BigCommerce redirects the user to the Auth
                              Callback URI provided during app registration. The
                              Auth Callback URI must be publicly available,
                              fully qualified, and served over TLS.

                              ### Handling Requests Securely


                              The request comes from the client browser, rather
                              than directly from BigCommerce. This allows you to
                              use a non-publicly-available Auth Callback URI
                              while testing your app.


                              For security, Auth and Load callback should be
                              handled server-side. If you are building a
                              client-side application (such as an AngularJS
                              Single Page App), you should handle Auth and Load
                              callbacks outside that application. Use a separate
                              service that accepts the Auth and Load callback
                              requests, generates tokens, validates requests,
                              and then redirects the user to your client-side
                              app’s entry point.

                              ## Receiving the GET Request


                              The GET request to your Auth Callback URI contains
                              a temporary code that you can exchange for a
                              permanent OAuth token. It also includes a unique
                              value that identifies the store installing or
                              updating your app, as well as authorized scopes.


                              The following table details the full list of
                              parameters and values included in the GET request
                              from BigCommerce to your Auth Callback URI.
                              BigCommerce passes these within the URI itself as
                              query parameters.


                              | Parameter | Description |

                              | --- | --- |

                              | code | Temporary code to exchange for a
                              permanent OAuth token. See [Making the POST
                              request](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#making-post-request)
                              below for more information about this exchange. |

                              | scope | List of scopes authorized by the user.
                              As a best practice, your app should validate this
                              list to ensure that it matches the app&#39;s
                              needs, and fail if it does not. However, at this
                              time, the user does not have any opportunity to
                              pick and choose between scopes. The dialog
                              presented to the user requires the user to approve
                              all scopes or none. |

                              | context | The store hash: a unique value that
                              identifies the store on which a logged-in user has
                              clicked to install or your app. BigCommerce passes
                              this along with a context path, as follows:
                              `stores/{store_hash}`. Save the store hash value,
                              because you will need to pass it in all your
                              requests to the Stores API. |


                              ### Example – Initial Installation


                              This example initiates the token exchange, with a
                              requested scope of store_v2_orders:


                              ```

                              GET
                              /auth?code=qr6h3thvbvag2ffq&scope=store_v2_orders&context=stores/g5cd38
                              HTTP/1.1  

                              Host: app.example.com

                              ```



                              ### Example – Updating Scopes

                              The following example requests a scope of
                              store_v2_products, in addition to the initially
                              requested scope of store_v2_orders:


                              ```

                              GET
                              /auth?code=qr6h3thvbvag2ffq&scope=store_v2_orders+store_v2_products&context=stores/g5cd38
                              HTTP/1.1  

                              Host: app.example.com

                              ```
                            header:
                              anchor: recieving-get-request
                          - type: callout
                            data:
                              body: >-
                                Note that when your app receives a new token,
                                any previously issued token is invalidated.
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## Responding to the GET Request


                              Upon receiving the GET request at your Auth
                              Callback URI, your app should return some HTML to
                              the merchant browser. BigCommerce renders this in
                              an iframe inside of the control panel. It could be
                              a form that collects further information from the
                              user, or you could redirect the user to your app’s
                              main page. If you do not pass back some HTML, the
                              user will be left looking at a blank screen. Such
                              an app would not be accepted into the App
                              Marketplace.
                            header:
                              anchor: responding-get-request
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## Making the POST Request


                              The POST request’s primary purpose is to exchange
                              the temporary access code for a permanent OAuth
                              token. However, your app must pass a number of
                              additional values to accomplish the exchange. Pass
                              the parameters and their values inside the request
                              body, using query parameters and URL-encoding. To
                              achieve this, you must include the following HTTP
                              headers:


                              ```

                              Content-Type: application/json

                              ```

                              Make the POST request to the following address:
                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/oauth2/token`.


                              ### Initial Installation


                              During initial installation, upon receiving the
                              POST, BigCommerce marks the status of your app as
                              “Installed”, removes the progress-indicator
                              overlay, and places your app icon in the control
                              panel’s left-hand navigation. With the
                              progress-indicator overlay removed, the user can
                              interact with the HTML that you returned in your
                              GET response.
                            header:

                          - type: callout
                            data:
                              body: >-
                                During app updates, upon receiving the POST,
                                BigCommerce removes the update prompt from the
                                control panel.
                          - type: text

                              The POST response will include a JSON object
                              containing the permanent OAuth token, user
                              information, and other values. Upon receiving the
                              permanent OAuth token, store it securely. You
                              should also store the user and store hash values,
                              to identify the user and store at load and
                              uninstall. The following sections detail the
                              contents of the JSON body.

This causes BigCommerce to send a GET request to the Load Callback URI that you provided. In a production environment, the Load Callback URI must be publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL.\n\n```\nThe GET request contains a signed payload, as shown below.\nGET /load?signed_payload=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1\nHost: app.example.com\n```\n\nUpon receiving a GET request to the Load Callback URI, your app needs to [process the signed payload](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#processing-signed-payload). After processing the payload, your app returns its user interface as HTML. BigCommerce renders this inside of an iframe. Please see [User Interface Constraints](#user-interface-constraints) for important information about your app’s user interface.\n\n### Uninstall Request (Optional)\n\nStore owners have the option to uninstall any app at any time. When a store owner uninstalls an app, the app’s OAuth token is revoked and the app cannot make requests to the Stores API on the store’s behalf anymore.\n\nYou do not need to provide an Uninstall Callback URI. The lack of an Uninstall Callback URI does not prevent uninstallation. Instead, the Uninstall Callback URI allows you to track store owners who uninstall your app and to run cleanup operations, such as removing the store’s user accounts from your system.\nShould you choose to avail of this option and provide an Uninstall Callback URI, please note that it must be publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL. If provided, BigCommerce will send a GET request to your Uninstall Callback URI when a store owner clicks to uninstall your app.\n\nExample of a GET Request sent to the Uninstall Callback URI\n```\nGET /uninstall?signed_payload=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1\n\tHost: app.example.com\n```\nUpon receiving the GET request, your app will need to process the signed payload."

                              enable multi-user support, you can optionally
                              specify a Remove User Callback URI. It must be
                              fully qualified, publicly available, and served
                              over TLS/SSL. BigCommerce will send a GETrequest
                              to your Remove User Callback URI when a store
                              admin revokes a user’s access to your app.

                              Upon receiving the GET request, your app will need

                              ## Processing the Signed Payload


                              Processing the signed payload involves splitting
                              and decoding it verifying the HMAC signature, and
                              processing the JSON object.


                              ### Splitting and Decoding the Signed Payload


                              The signed payload is a string containing a
                              base64url-encoded JSON string and a
                              base64url-encoded HMAC signature. The parts are
                              delimited by the .character:


                              ```

                              encoded_json_string.encoded_hmac_signature

                              ```



                              To decode the signed payload, complete the
                              following steps:

                              * Split signed_payload into its two parts at the
                              `.` delimiter.

                              * Decode encoded_json_string using base64url.

                              * Convert the decoded JSON string into an object.
                              See Processing the JSON object for more about this
                              object.

                              * Decode encoded_hmac_signature using base64url.

                              * Use your client secret to verify the signature.
                              See the next section for more details.


                              ### Verifying the HMAC Signature


                              To verify the payload, you need to sign the
                              payload using your client secret, and confirm that
                              it matches the signature that was sent in the
                              request.

                              ### Processing the JSON Object


                              The JSON object embedded in the signed_payload
                              contains information about the BigCommerce store
                              and the store owner or user.


                              ### Identifying the Store

                              You should use the store information endpoint to
                              identify the store to which the request pertains.


                              ### Interpreting the User Information


                              Interpreting the user information varies as
                              follows:


                              | Request type | Multiple users enabled | Multiple
                              users not enabled |

                              | --- | --- | --- |

                              | Load | Compare the user information to see if it
                              matches that of the store owner, received at the
                              time of [app
                              installation](#installation-update-sequence) or
                              that of an existing user. If the user information
                              does not match either of these, then it represents
                              a new user that you should add to your database or
                              other storage. | The information should match that
                              of the store owner, received at the time of [app
                              installation](#installation-update-sequence). |

                              | Uninstall | The user information should match
                              that of the store owner. Only the store owner can
                              uninstall your app. | Should match the store
                              owner. |

                              | Remove user | The user information should match
                              one of the users that you have stored. After
                              locating the stored user, delete it from your
                              database or other storage. | N/A |


                              ### JSON Values


                              | Name | Data Type | Value Description |

                              | --- | --- | --- |

                              | user.id | integer | Unique identifier for the
                              user who initiated the callback. |

                              | user.email | string | Email address of the user
                              who initiated the callback. |

                              | owner.id | integer | Unique identifier for the
                              user listed as the store owner. |

                              | owner.email | string | Email address of the user
                              listed as the store owner. |

                              | context | string | The context value is part of
                              the API path for this store and includes the
                              store_hash. |

                              | store_hash | string |Unique identifier for the
                              store. |

                              | timestamp | float | The time (in Unix time) when

                              ## Multi-User Support


                              When you register your app with BigCommerce,
                              enabling multi-user support will allow store
                              admins to manually authorize users – other than
                              the store owner – to load the app. 


                              As soon as you enable multi-user support, this
                              affects the control panel of any store that has
                              your app installed. If you already have an app
                              published in the App Marketplace, be aware that
                              this setting takes effect immediately. Therefore,
                              we recommend testing your multi-user support using
                              a separate app that is in draft status.


                              Let your customers know that you’ve enabled this
                              feature. Otherwise, they won’t know that they can
                              start granting access to users.


                              If this is added after the app has launched, then
                              during update the app scope will change and users
                              will be alerted of the new permission request.


                              ### The Control Panel Experience

                              Store admins will be able to adjust user
                              permissions to grant/deny other store users’
                              access to your app. The next time the user logs
                              in, they will see any apps for which they have
                              been granted access. The user can then click on
                              the app icon in the left navigation to load it.

                              Use your draft app and your sandbox store to
                              review this behavior.


                              ### The Load Request

                              Apps with multiple users enabled can expect more
                              than just the store owner’s email and ID in the
                              JSON object sent in the load request. If a load
                              request is sent with information for a user you
                              haven’t seen yet, you should provision the user
                              account and associate it with the store in your
                              database.


                              Because you know the store owner’s email and ID
                              from the App Installation sequence, your app can
                              distinguish store owners from other users. This
                              allows you to provide different user experiences
                              based on the information in the load request. Here
                              is a summary of the two types of users:


                              - Store owner: Can install, uninstall, and load
                              apps.

                              - Users: Cannot install or uninstall apps.
                              Permitted only to load the apps that a store admin
                              has authorized.


                              For further details, please see [Load Request and
                              Response](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests).


                              ### The Remove User Request

                              In addition to their ability to add users, store
                              admins can also remove users. This action
                              generates a GET request to the Remove User
                              Callback URI that you provided in My Apps. Your
                              app should delete from its records the user
                              identified in the request.


                              For further information, please see [Remove User
                              Request](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests).

                              Apps can be installed from outside the BigCommerce
                              control panel. An example of this would be having
                              an install link on your company’s site that
                              directs the merchant to download your app. 

                              Render Success/Failure Pages

                              Modify your application code to serve either a
                              success or failure page, depending on whether the
                              external installation was successful or
                              unsuccessful.


                              If you skip this step, your application will load
                              in the iframe created by your button. To ensure a
                              good experience for your merchants, we strongly
                              recommend that you return a confirmation page,
                              instead of allowing your application to be loaded
                              in that modal.


                              ### Handling Errors


                              If your application’s installation was initiated
                              and completed through an external link,
                              BigCommerce will send your auth callback endpoint
                              an extra parameter called external_install.

                              If you receive this parameter and there are no
                              errors, call:


                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/<your_app_client_id>/install/succeeded`


                              If there were errors, call:

                              `https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/<your_app_client_id>/install/failed`


                              Below is a sample code snippet of an auth callback
                              that does this:
                            header:
                              anchor: external-app-installation
                          - type: code
                            data: |2-
                                 if params['external_install']
                                      return get 'https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/m8e1mkkmjw2xjinydqz7ie05to1y2nk/install/succeeded'
                                  end

                                  redirect '/'

                              rescue => e
                                  if params['external_install']
                                      return get 'https://login.bigcommerce.com/app/m8e1mkkmjw2xjinydqz7ie05to1y2nk/install/failed'
                                  end
                            header:
                              title: Auth Callback
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              Depending on which endpoint you call, we will
                              render one of the following success/failed pages
                              to the modal.
                          - type: text
                            data: >-
                              ## User Interface Constraints


                              Auth apps benefit from a high level of integration
                              with the BigCommerce platform. Users interacting
                              with your app will enjoy a seamless experience.
                              BigCommerce achieves this by rendering your
                              app&#39;s user interface inside of an iframe
                              within the control panel. To ensure acceptance
                              into the App Marketplace, your app should be able
                              to perform all of its functions inside of the
                              iframe.


                              While very usable and friendly, the iframe
                              approach does require special attention from app
                              developers. The remainder of this page discusses
                              several functional areas to consider when
                              designing and developing your app.


                              ### About Mixed Content


                              The BigCommerce control panel is served over
                              TLS/SSL. Your app must be hosted on a web server
                              that accepts and sends TLS/SSL requests. In
                              addition, all of the resources referenced in the
                              HTML that you present to the end users must be
                              served over TLS/SSL. You may find
                              protocol-agnostic addressing helpful.


                              If the user interface retrieves images, scripts,
                              or other assets over a connection not encrypted
                              with TLS/SSL, the user will experience errors and
                              possibly an inability to interact with your app.
                              Before submitting your app, use an <a
                              href="https://www.jitbit.com/sslcheck/"
                              target="_blank">online crawler</a> to check for
                              insecure content.


                              ### About Same-Origin Policies


                              <a
                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy"
                              target="_blank">Same-origin policies</a> restrict
                              apps running within iframes from performing
                              certain activities, such as interacting with other
                              services and making OAuth connections. While apps
                              that operate within the BigCommerce iframe get
                              strong preference during App Marketplace
                              considerations, we sometimes make exceptions for
                              apps that need to interact with, and authenticate
                              to, other services. If your app requires this, we
                              advise you to open a new tab for actions that
                              cannot occur within the iframe.


                              ### About P3P and Cookies


                              Internet Explorer is one of the browsers that
                              BigCommerce [supports](#supported-browsers), and
                              our merchants do use it to access the control
                              panel. If your app needs to set a cookie, you will
                              need to craft a <a
                              href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P"
                              target="_blank">P3P policy</a>. Otherwise, your
                              app will experience issues on Internet Explorer.

                              Webhooks allow app developers to be notified, in
                              near real-time, when specific events occur on a
                              BigCommerce store. For example, your app may need
                              to perform an action when a new order is created,
                              a product’s inventory decreases, or an item is
                              added to a shopper’s cart. When a subscribed event
                              occurs on a store, BigCommerce will POST a payload
                              to your app’s callback URI so your app can take
                              some action based on that event.

                                when the merchant imports 2,000 products, we
                                will send 2,000 individual callback events.

                              ## Authentication


                              Webhooks are authenticated using Oauth and support
                              the JSON media type. Basic auth and XML are not
                              supported.


                              Before you  can begin to send and receive
                              requests, you must have the following:


                              * A store: You can get a sandbox store by joining
                              the Partner Program.

                              * OAuth Client ID: Obtained by creating an API
                              Account.

                              * OAuth token: Obtained by creating an API
                              Account.

                              * Valid TLS/SSL configuration: Verify your app
                              server’s setup at the following site:
                              [https://sslcheck.globalsign.com](https://sslcheck.globalsign.com)

                            data:

                                * Hostname/DNS mismatch.

                                * Self-signed certificate.

                              ## Lightweight Callback Payload


                              When a subscribed event occurs, we send a light
                              payload with only minimum details regarding the
                              event that’s been triggered. This gives you
                              maximum flexibility as to how you want to handle
                              the notification in your application. For
                              instance, if you subscribe to the
                              `store/order/statusUpdated` event, we’ll send you
                              the order ID when the status is updated. You might
                              want to handle the notification by fetching the
                              full order details via a request to the Orders
                              resource.


                              An example payload follows:


                              ```

                              {
                               "store_id":11111,
                               "producer":"stores/abcde",
                               "scope":"store/order/statusUpdated",
                               "data":{
                                       "type":"order",
                                       "id":173331
                                      },
                               "hash":"3f9ea420af83450d7ef9f78b08c8af25b2213637"
                               }
                              ```
                            header:
                              anchor: lightweight-callback-payload
                          - type: text
                            data: '---'

                            data: >-

If you choose to include a headers object, BigCommerce will include the name-value pair(s) in the HTTP header of its POST requests to your callback URI at runtime. While this feature could be used for any purpose, one is to use it to set a secret authorization key and check it at runtime. This provides an additional level of assurance that the POST request came from BigCommerce instead of some other party, such as a malicious actor. (Optional) | string |\n|is_active | Value specifies whether a webhook is active or inactive. By default, new webhooks will be set to be inactive and will have a blank value. If you want to create a webhook that should be active initially, you can pass the following name-value pair: \"is_active\": true.

                              ## Respond to Webhook Callbacks


                              You’ll need to build an application and configure
                              your server to receive the callback we send when
                              events are triggered.


                              To acknowledge that you received the webhook
                              without issue, your server should return a 200
                              HTTP status code. Any other information you return
                              in the request headers or request body will be
                              ignored. Any response code outside the 200 range,
                              including 3_xx_ codes, will indicate to us that
                              you did not receive the webhook. When a webhook is
                              not received (for whatever reason), we will retry
                              the callback as described below.

                              ## Callback Retry Mechanism


                              The webhooks service will do its best to deliver
                              events to your callback URI. If your server
                              indicates that the webhook payload has not been
                              received, the dispatch service will take the
                              following actions:

                              If an app server responds to a webhook payload
                              with anything other than a 2_xx_ response, or
                              times out, the app will be blocked for 60 seconds.

                              Webhooks created during that 60-second block will
                              be queued up to send on the next scheduled retry
                              attempt after the block expires, so that webhooks
                              are not lost.


                              The webhook dispatcher will then attempt several
                              retries (at increasing intervals) until the
                              maximum retry limit is reached.


                              ### Retry Intervals


                              * 60 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 180 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 180 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 300 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 900 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 1800 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 3600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 7200 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 21600 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 50400 seconds after the most recent failure  

                              * 86400 seconds (24 hours) after the most recent
                              failure


                              After the final retry attempt (cumulatively, 48
                              hours after the first delivery attempt), the
                              webhook will automatically be deactivated, and we
                              will send an email to the developer’s email
                              address registered on the subscribing app. You can
                              reactivate the webhook by setting the `is_active`
                              flag back to true via a `/PUT` request to the
                              hooks resource.

                              ## Webhook Security

                              To ensure that webhook payloads are secure against
                              activity by a malicious actor, we take a
                              three-pronged approach:


                              * Webhook payloads contain minimal information
                              about the store and event, for example the ID
                              identifying the order or cart. To access
                              potentially sensitive information on a store, a
                              malicious actor would need to be fully
                              authenticated against that store’s API in order to
                              request full details.

                              * Webhook payloads are sent over a TLS-encrypted
                              connection.

                              * For added security, you can include custom
                              headers in your webhook creation request, and
                              these headers will be sent in the payload when an
                              event you subscribe to occurs. If your app
                              endpoint is secured by basic authentication, you
                              could set your own basic auth headers to
                              authenticate the payload at runtime.

                              ## Troubleshooting


                              ### Why am I not receiving event payloads to my
                              callback URI?

                              If your app does not return an HTTP 2_xx_ to
                              BigCommerce after receiving the webhook event
                              payload, BigCommerce considers it a failure.
                              BigCommerce will keep trying for a little over 48
                              hours. At the end of that time, BigCommerce sends
                              an email to the email address set during app
                              registration and disables the webhook by setting
                              the is_active flag to false.


                              You can proactively check to make sure that
                              everything is OK by periodically making a GET
                              request and checking the is_active flag.


                              If you receive an email or discover that the
                              is_active flag has been flipped to false, try the
                              following:


                              Check to see if your app is responding to the
                              event payload with something other than HTTP 200.

                              Check to make sure that your server has a valid
                              TLS/SSL setup. One way to do this is by visiting
                              the following website:
                              https://sslcheck.globalsign.com. Any of the
                              following will cause the TLS/SSL handshake to
                              fail:

                              Self-signed certificate.

                              Host name of the certificate does not match the
                              server’s DNS.

                              Your server’s key or trust store has not been
                              loaded up with the intermediate certificates
                              necessary to establish the chain of trust.

                              Once you have resolved the issue preventing the
                              connection, send a PUT request to flip the
                              is_active flag back to true. This will cause
                              BigCommerce to start sending the event payloads to
                              your callback URI again.


                              ### Why am I not receiving a 201 response after
                              creating a webhook?

                              After sending a POST request to create a webhook,
                              you should get an HTTP 201 back. If you do not,
                              check your TLS/SSL setup and be sure that your
                              request contains the following headers:


                              ```
                                   Accept: application/json
                                   Content-Type: application/json

                              **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)**  

                              As you are building your integration, you might
                              want to test webhooks on your local dev machines.


                              We suggest using ngrok, which you can use to
                              easily set up tunnels between a server running on
                              localhost and a public URL. This will enable you
                              to send our webhooks to your localhost
                              environments via a public URL. No production push
                              is required.


                              Need help on ngrok and webhooks see our

                              There are three ways to install ngrok: 

                              - Install manually and then set the $PATH so ngrok
                              can be used globally. 

                              - Download as an
                              [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok)
                              module. 

                              - Download manually and place in the project
                              folder. (Method we are using)


                              ### Mac/Linux


                              1. Visit https://ngrok.com/ and click on download.

                              `store/product/updated`. 


                              1. Create a POST request using the try it now box
                              below or your api enviroment of
                              choice.`https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v2/hooks`.
                              Replace store_hash with your store.

                              2. Create a body request with the webhook we are
                              subscribing to and your forwarding url:


                              ```

                              {

                              }

                              ```


                              The destination url is the forwarding url from
                              ngrok and /webhooks, matching the URL path set in
                              the app POST.  


                              3. Update the headers to have:

                              ```
                                  Accept: application/json
                                  Content-Type: application/json

                              ```

                              4. Check all the values and then hit POST. The
                              response will be 201 Created if headers and scope
                              are correct.

                              ## Fire Webhooks

                              You can fire the webhook in two ways. Either the
                              API or the store’s control panel. We are going to
                              cover both.


                              ### Update via the Control Panel


                              1. From your store’s control panel, navigate to
                              Products > View. Choose a product and change some
                              of the information. In this case, the word Hoodie
                              was added to the product name. Then click save.

                              maxHeight: '800'

                              2. Visit the Ngrok web interface address (in the
                              sample app it’s http://127.0.0.1:4040), and check
                              for a 200 response.

                              Under Summary you can see the webhook has fired.
                              It returned the text OK. This can be changed. In
                              the original app, res.send(‘OK’). This can be
                              changed to say something different or even post
                              the response to another app.  


                              The response will also show in the terminal.

                              ## Update Via the API

                              Create a PUT request to the product that needs to
                              be updated. 


                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products/124`


                              In this example, the price of product_id 124 is
                              being changed to 12.99.


                              After hitting send, check the ngrok web interface.
                              You may have more or less events based on how many
                              times the product has been updated in the previous
                              step.

                              That’s it. In this walkthrough you created a
                              webhook, setup a server to accept the response and
                              used Express. Some extra things are to change the
                              text in res.send() to have a custom response,
                              print the response to a webpage or setup a
                              different webhook.

                                will stop working. Send a [DELETE]() request to
                                the specific webhook id.

                              ## Next Steps


                              Additionally, you can change the text in
                              res.send() to have a custom response, print the
                              response to a webpage or set up a different
                              webhook. You can also send in custom headers as a
                              way to verify the hook or get custom hook
                              information back. Setup the destination using a
                              permanent url such as creating an
                              [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app, then having
                              the response print to the screen. 


                              To send in custom headers, during the /POST or
                              /PUT request add in:


                              ```

                              {
                                "scope": "store/order/*",
                                "headers": {
                                  "X-Custom-Auth-Header": "{secret_auth_password}"
                                },
                                "destination": "https://app.example.com/orders",
                                "is_active": true
                              }

                              ```

                              The custom header can be anything you choose. It
                              can be used to check the security of an incoming
                              webhook. Anything without the custom header should
                              be rejected.



                              Response:


                              ```

                              1. Getting a 404 error using the root (/) url?


                              Add this snippet to your code to respond to
                              incoming get requests with 'hello'.


                              ```

                              app.get('/',(req, res)=>{
                                  res.send('Hello!');
                              }); 

                              ```


                              2. Getting error ngrok not found?

                              There are two ways to fix this. Your local setup
                              will determine which command will work.

                              Use the command `mv ngrok /usr/local/bin `to move
                              ngrok to your local bin folder. This way it
                              becomes available globally. 

                              Use the command `./ngrok http 3000` to run ngrok
                              as a sudo user.

                              | store/cart/lineItem/* | This webhook will fire
                              when a change occurs to line items in the cart.
                              This can be items added to a cart, removed or
                              updated.(Ex. change to quantity, product options
                              or price). |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/created | When a new item is
                              added to the cart  |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/updated | When an item’s

                              change. |

                              | store/cart/lineItem/deleted | When an item is
                              deleted from the cart|

                              | store/cart/created | This webhook will fire
                              whenever a new cart is created either via a
                              storefront shopper adding their first item to the
                              cart or when a new cart being created via an API
                              consumer. If it is from the storefront, then it
                              fires when the first product is added to a new
                              session.(The cart did not exist before) For the
                              API it means a  `POST`  to /carts, (V3 and
                              Storefront API). The  `store/cart/updated`  will
                              also fire.|

                              | store/cart/updated | This webhook is fired
                              whenever a cart is modified through the changes in
                              its line items. Eg. when a new item is added to a
                              cart, an existing item’s quantity is updated, when
                              the email changes during guest checkout or an
                              existing item is deleted, the cart is modified
                              triggering this webhook. The payload will include
                              the ID of the cart being updated. <br> This
                              webhook is also fired along with cart created
                              because the first product being added to an empty
                              cart triggers an update. <br> - Logging into
                              customer account after creating a cart (email is
                              inherited from customer account email) <br>-
                              Entering email address via guest checkout <br>
                              -Changing the email in guest checkout |

                              | store/cart/deleted| This webhook will fire
                              whenever a cart is deleted. This is can be either
                              when all items have been removed from a cart and
                              it was auto-deleted or it was explicitly removed
                              via a DELETE request by an API consumer. This ends
                              the lifecycle of the cart. The 
                              `store/cart/updated`  webhook will also fire when
                              the last item is removed.|

                              | store/cart/couponApplied | This webhook will
                              fire whenever a new coupon code is applied to a
                              cart. It will include the ID of the coupon code |

                              | store/cart/abandoned | This webhook will fire
                              whenever a cart is considered abandoned. In the
                              BigCommerce store settings if enabled this is
                              usually set to one hour. [See Abandoned
                              Cart](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-the-Abandoned-Cart-Saver/).

                              | store/cart/converted | This hook fires when a
                              cart is converted into an order, which is
                              typically after the payment step of checkout on
                              the storefront. At this point, the Cart is no
                              longer accessible and has been deleted. This hook
                              returns both the Cart ID and Order ID for
                              correlation purposes. |

                              The Catalog refers to a store’s collection of
                              physical and digital products. The Catalog
                              includes all the information about a product such
                              as MPN, warranty, price, and images.

                              Products are the primary catalog entity, and the
                              primary function of the e-commerce platform is to
                              sell products on the storefront and other selling
                              channels.


                              Products can either be
                              [Simple](#create-simple-product) or
                              [Complex](#create-complex-product). 


                              Products can also be Physical or Digital. 


                              * Physical products are typically products that
                              exist in a physical form, have a weight, and are
                              being sold by retailers with the intent of
                              shipping them to customers. 


                              * Digital products, on the other hand, may not
                              have a physical representation in the real world;
                              this includes downloadable products such as
                              computer software, ebooks, music, images, and
                              other digital media. Alternatively, a digital
                              product may be used to sell services such as spa
                              treatments, consulting, and so forth - which also
                              do not require shipping.

                              modifiers, or variants, and therefore cannot be
                              configured or modified before they are added to
                              cart. A simple product is its own variant.

                              Digital products are not physical items that are
                              shipped out. Such as manuals, ebooks or music.
                              Attached to a digital product is a Downloadable
                              product file.


                              Downloadable product files are intended for
                              products of the “digital” type, typically for
                              selling some kind of media file or software. They
                              don’t have dimensions since an item is never
                              shipped out.


                              Files must be added to digital products using the
                              [Control Panel or using
                              WebDav.](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Creating-Downloadable-Products/#adding-downloadable-product)

                              file and maximum downloads can be set in the
                              Control Panel.

                              Product images are used to show shoppers what
                              they’re buying and merchandise products. When
                              creating an image, `image_url` or an `image_file`
                              can be passed in.

                              images, more than one can be added by expanding
                              the images array.

                              Only one image can be the product thumbnail. The
                              product thumbnail is the image that shows on the
                              product listing page, in search results and any
                              other location that features the product. If only
                              one image is on the product it becomes both the
                              thumbnail and the main product image. Images can
                              also be added to
                              [variants](/api-docs/catalog/products/product-variants).

                              Product Videos, in addition to images, can help

                              sell the product. A product can have more than one
                              video.


                              * Product videos must be hosted on YouTube. The

                              Custom fields are a feature intended for product
                              specifications, in a key: value arrangement. As an
                              example, there might be fields indicating
                              technical specifications about an LED TV  such as
                              screen size, maximum resolution, HDR support, etc.

                              grape, etc. Custom fields can not be used to add
                              rules such as changing the weight or price of a
                              product.

                              Bulk Pricing Rules are intended for merchants who
                              want to offer wholesale discounts for buying in
                              bulk. They apply once products are added to cart,
                              but they are displayed as a callout on the
                              storefront to let shoppers know how they can save.


                              Bulk Pricing rules in the catalog are on the
                              product, meaning that they’ll trigger even if
                              several different variants of the product are in
                              the cart, as long as the total quantity of those
                              variants meets one of the quantity breaks. [Price
                              List bulk pricing](http://) works differently.

                              Variant options are any choices that the shopper
                              needs to make that will result in the selection of
                              a variant. Color and Size are typical examples of
                              Variant Options.  A t-shirt can have different
                              combinations of sizes and colors.  


                              Example:

                              * Color is a Variant Option while Red, Orange, and
                              Green are Variant Option Values

                              * Size is a Variant Option while Small, Medium,
                              and Large are Variant Option Values


                              The combination of Small & Red is what is selected
                              on the storefront and correlates to a product
                              variation also called a SKU.

                              * Only support “multiple choice” option types

                              * Rectangle

                              * Radio button

                              * Color swatch

                              * Will automatically generate variants when
                              created in the CP

                              ## Create Variant Options

                              The following request will create options, but the
                              SKU’s are not updated and they are not a variant
                              on the product. Variant SKUs must be created with
                              a separate request. Variant options will show on
                              the storefront as an option that can be selected
                              by the customer. A request like this could be used
                              to add new choices to a variant that has already
                              been created.

                              Variants represent an item as it sits on the shelf
                              in the warehouse or a particular saleable product.
                              A product might be a t-shirt, while the variant
                              would be “a small, red t-shirt”. Variants are
                              selected by shoppers on the storefront via Product
                              Options. In the case where a product is simple,
                              meaning it does not have any options, the product
                              is its own variant - called a base variant.
                              Everything you can buy should be a variant.


                              * Options build out variants. 

                              * Variants are usually what inventory is tracked
                              against 

                              * Can have their own price, weight, dimensions,
                              image, etc - or they can inherit these values from
                              the product if they have not been specified

                              * Must have a SKU code (unless they’re a base
                              variant)

                              * In the case of non-base variants, variants will
                              relate to a particular combination of variant
                              option values - such as “small” and “red”

                              Variants can be created in two ways:

                              * From existing variant options using the variant
                              options endpoint.
                              [v3/catalog/products/{product_id}/options
                              ](http://)

                              * By adding the variants with variant options and
                              skus when creating the product. See [Create a
                              Complex Product](http://).


                              This will go over using existing variant options
                              to create the variants.


                              Use the
                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products/131/options`
                              endpoint to get the option information.

                              In the above response, there are two variant
                              options of size and color with three values each. 


                              To combine the variant option values into variants
                              and build out SKU’s use the following endpoint:


                              `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products/131/variants`

                                Variants need to be created one at a time using
                                this endpoint. Only one variant option at a time
                                can be created; individual variant options will
                                contain an array of multiple values. To use a
                                variant array and create them at the same time
                                use the [/catalog/product]() endpoint during
                                product creation.

                              the /products endpoint. You can use this method to
                              create a product and its variants in a single call
                              without creating variant options first, but not
                              all option types are supported by this method.

                              Modifier options are any choices that the shopper
                              can make that will change the way the merchant
                              fulfills the product. Examples include:

                              * A checkbox to add shipping insurance

                              * Text to be engraved on the product

                              * A color that an unfinished product is to be
                              painted before it’s shipped
                               
                              Critically, the modifier will not change the
                              SKU/variant being fulfilled, and you cannot track
                              inventory against combinations of modifier values.
                              Modifiers typically would not change which product
                              is “picked off the shelf” in the warehouse, but
                              they change what happens to that product before
                              it’s sent to the shopper, or how it’s sent.
                               
                              Modifier options:

                              * May be required or non-required

                              * Support all option types

                              * Cannot be used as part of a variant



                              An adjuster can be added to a modifier option to
                              change things such as adding to the price,
                              changing the weight or shipping rules.  Adjusters
                              cannot be applied to all modifiers.

                              The following example shows how to add a modifier
                              - checkbox with a price adjuster - increase price
                              by five dollars. Checkboxes have to made in two
                              steps.  The reason is that it creates more than
                              one modifier. A checkbox is a yes or no which is
                              listed as two different `option_values`.

                              Complex rules allow merchants to set up conditions
                              and actions based on shopper option selections on
                              the storefront. You can use them to vary the
                              following based on option selections made by the
                              shopper:

                              * Price

                              * Weight

                              * Image

                              * Purchasability


                              Adjustments made by complex rules are displayed to
                              shoppers in real-time on the storefront.


                              For the majority of merchant use cases, **best
                              practice** will be to either assign values (such
                              as a price) directly to a variant or use adjusters
                              on the modifier option itself. However complex
                              rules exist for rare cases where a rule condition
                              is too complex to express in those forms easily. 


                              Use complex rules when an adjustment should be
                              triggered by:

                              * The selection of values across multiple modifier
                              options

                              * The combination of a particular variant/SKU and
                              a modifier option value.

                              Complex rules must be based on a combination of
                              two or more modifiers, such as two checkboxes. The
                              following example will add $10 to the product
                              price when both boxes are checked.

                              Metafields allow a developer to setup key and
                              namespace pairs. The data does not appear in the
                              storefront or the control panel. This is useful
                              for when information needs to be passed back and
                              forth between an app and the store. 


                              Metafields can be added to variants, products,
                              categories, and brands.

                              A product review is used to give shoppers the
                              option to rate the products they have purchased.
                              The reviews are located on the same page as the
                              product. 


                              Reviews are not able to be created in the control
                              panel, but they can be created via API. Creating
                              them via API is useful if you are migrating to
                              BigCommerce and do not want to lose existing
                              reviews. Product Reviews are native to the
                              platform but can be turned off in favor of a
                              custom setup.

                              Brands are another form of catalog taxonomy,
                              similar to Categories. However, there are a few
                              differences.


                              * Exist as a single “list” on the store, with no
                              tree structure

                              * Can only have a single assignment to a product;
                              a product may have at most one brand, but a brand
                              can have many products.
                               
                              They’re primarily used to tag products so that
                              consumers can find Brands they’re interested in
                              (such as Nike shoes). Brands have their own page
                              on the storefront which shows all the products in
                              that Brand. They’re also used as part of faceted
                              search navigation.

                              Categories are a hierarchy of products available
                              on the store, presented in a tree structure.
                              Currently, a store’s category structure determines
                              the primary menu structure of most storefront
                              themes, which are directly tied to it.


                              All products must be associated with at least one
                              Category, although a Category does not need to
                              have any products. Unlike some e-commerce
                              platforms, products on BigCommerce can be
                              associated with more than one Category. 


                              A product associated with categories does not
                              currently have any priority or weighted order
                              (there’s no “primary category”), which can make it
                              difficult to integrate with some external systems
                              which might wish to use a product’s categories to
                              map to a category structure in that external
                              system.

                        * Storefront single click applications

                        ## Script Manager API Partner Guidelines


                        With the Script Manager API, your Apps now have the
                        ability to insert scripts into a user’s storefront
                        without requiring the user to manually paste a snippet
                        of code into their control panel. You can freely update
                        these scripts while your App is installed, and, if
                        desired, automatically remove scripts if your App is
                        uninstalled.


                        For Apps being installed on our latest theme engine
                        (Stencil), this process is relatively straightforward.
                        However, if your App is already live, you may have
                        already asked merchants to paste a code snippet in one
                        of these two sections in the control panel:


                        - Footer Scripts

                        - Web Analytics


                        Also, since our older (Blueprint-based) themes do not
                        support the Script Manager API, you’ll still need some
                        way of providing users of older themes the documentation
                        they need, without burdening users of newer themes with
                        additional, unnecessary steps.


                        To help you transition to the Script Manager API, we’ve
                        provided some recommended strategies to deal with these
                        different situations. 


                        #### Stencil vs Blueprint


                        As mentioned above, BigCommerce supports two theme
                        engines: Stencil and Blueprint. Stencil is our latest
                        technology, and all new stores only have access to
                        Stencil themes. However, older stores may still be using
                        our legacy theme engine, Blueprint, which does not have
                        the ability to render scripts inserted through the
                        Script Manager API.


                        Because of this, you’ll need to check whether a user is
                        running Stencil to determine if their store supports the
                        Script Manager API. To do this, use the [Get Store
                        Information
                        API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v2/#store-information-reference)
                        endpoint and check the `stencil_enabled` flag. (requires
                        [store_v2_information_read_only
                        scope](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/#oauth-scopes)).

                        To better understand the content of this document, you
                        should be familiar with the app installation procedure,
                        which is outlined here:

                        ## Upgrades and Installation


                        ### Installing An App on Stencil


                        For Apps being installed on Stencil stores, we recommend
                        inserting your scripts immediately after receiving the
                        POST response during the Auth Callback flow. Add your
                        scripts using the Create Script endpoint of the Script
                        Manager API.


                        We highly recommend leaving the auto_uninstall flag set
                        to true, so that your App will properly clean itself up
                        when uninstalled. More information about this flag can
                        be found <a href="script-object-properties">here</a>.


                        #### Upgrading Existing Apps on Stencil


                        If your App has already been released, you may have
                        existing users with pasted-in code somewhere in their
                        control panel. There are a few possible ways to deal
                        with this situation.


                        1.) __Do nothing__


                        If you don’t need to upgrade existing merchants to the
                        Script Manager API, it’s perfectly fine to leave them
                        as-is. You’ll need to maintain documentation for the
                        manual uninstallation process so that merchants with
                        older installations know what to clean up, and you won’t
                        be able to automatically update or add scripts for these
                        users. 


                        2.) __Prompt merchants to upgrade__


                        If you want your merchants to gradually update to the
                        new Script Manager over time, you can prompt them to do
                        so on your App’s landing page. You’ll need to keep track
                        of which of your merchants are not using the Script
                        Manager yet to know whether you need to display this
                        prompt. Also, make sure to check that they are running
                        Stencil (via the Get Store Information endpoint) before
                        prompting them to upgrade.


                        Once a user decides to upgrade, you can walk them
                        through removing the old pasted-in code in their control
                        panel, and then, once the merchant clicks a button,
                        install your scripts through the Script Manager API.


                        3.) __Silently upgrade to the Script Manager API__


                        Finally, if it’s possible for your old, pasted-in
                        scripts to live alongside the new Script Manager API
                        scripts, you may be able to upgrade to using the Script
                        Manager API without any user intervention being
                        required. Whether or not this is possible will vary
                        depending on the implementation of your App.


                        While your merchants will be loading more data on their
                        storefront pages than necessary, this method will allow
                        you to transition to using the Script Manager API for
                        all of your installations immediately. Keep in mind
                        you’ll still need to document the manual uninstallation
                        process for existing installations.


                        ### Installing Apps on Blueprint Stores 


                        As mentioned, the Blueprint theme engine does not
                        support the Script Manager API. Any scripts inserted
                        through this API will not be rendered on any storefront
                        pages. To prevent unpredictable behavior should a user
                        change their theme, we highly recommend checking the Get
                        Store Information endpoint for Stencil support prior to
                        installing any scripts through the Script Manager API.
                        Additionally, you’ll still want to show the old manual
                        installation steps when a store does not support
                        Stencil. 


                        ### Existing Blueprint Installations 


                        Existing blueprint installations won’t be affected, but
                        remember that if you are prompting existing Stencil
                        users to upgrade to the Script Manager, you’ll want to
                        suppress this message for Blueprint users.

                        ### Fixing Missing Scripts


                        It’s possible that your App installation may find itself
                        unexpectedly missing one or more scripts. Below are some
                        possible causes of this issue.


                        1.) __The Merchant Deleted Your Script__ 


                        Merchants are given a warning when attempting to delete
                        a script belonging to an App, but we do allow them to do
                        so.


                        If you want to handle this situation gracefully, we
                        recommend you check the [Get
                        Scripts](/api/v3/scripts.html#getallscripts) endpoint on
                        your App Detail Page (returned by the [Load Callback
                        URI](/api/#load-uninstall-and-user-removal-requests)) to
                        determine whether the expected scripts are present. If
                        they are not, you can prompt the user to click a button
                        to automatically repair their installation.


                        We ask that you request the user’s permission rather
                        than doing this automatically, as they may have had a
                        good reason for deleting the missing script. 


                        2.) __The Merchant's Theme is Not Set Up Correctly__ 


                        In order to render scripts, the theme templates must
                        have the handlebars expressions {{head.scripts}} and
                        {{footer.scripts}} in the pages where scripts should be
                        rendered. If either of these is absent, scripts on that
                        page with location set to head or footer (respectively)
                        will not be rendered.


                        Of particular note, {{head.scripts}} was only recently
                        added to the checkout and order confirmation pages in
                        our Cornerstone theme, and widespread adoption of this
                        standard outside of Cornerstone is still an ongoing
                        process.


                        To ensure your App is compatible with as many themes as
                        possible, we recommend footer over head for checkout,
                        order_confirmation and all_pages visibilities. 


                        3.) __Scripts Are Not Rendering in the Checkout and
                        Order Confirmation__ 


                        In order to render scripts, the store must have
                        BigCommerce’s Optimized one-page checkout enabled. This
                        is the default checkout type for all new Stencil stores.
                        Existing stores have to manually change the checkout
                        type as detailed in this article. 


                        Stencil themes from the marketplace support the
                        [Optimized One-Page
                        Checkout](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Optimized-Single-Page-Checkout#signup).
                        However, there could be instances where the merchant
                        maintains their own private theme and the theme has not
                        been updated to support the Optimized one-page checkout.
                        In this case, the merchant is required to add the theme
                        support, following the steps
                        [here](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/optimized-checkout-prereqs).

                        ## Notes


                        - If you are injecting scripts into the Checkout, you
                        will need to update the scope to Checkout Content.
                        Accounts can only be created by the [store
                        owner](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Store-API-Accounts/).

                        - Merchants will be able to see the scripts installed on
                        the store in the Control Panel. Within the native tag
                        manager, merchant actions will be limited to viewing a
                        script and deleting a script.

                        - Scripts can be located in the header
                        `{{head.scripts}}` or footer `{{footer.scripts}}`.

                        - Scripts Manager is only for Stencil themes. Blueprint
                        store users will still need to copy and paste in code.

                        - The current visibility options are `storefront`,
                        `checkout`, `all_pages` and `order_confirmation`.

                             `storefront`: All pages that are not `checkout` or `order_confirmation`.
                             
                             `all_pages`: Includes `storefront`, `checkout` and `order_confirmation`. This also includes the cart page. It **does not** include giftcertificates.php, 
                                            sitemap.php, account.php, and login.php.
                             
                        - Scripts injected via the Scripts API will not render
                        when you are developing a theme locally via Stencil CLI.

                        ## What is a Price List?


                        A Price List allows you to populate different versions
                        of catalog pricing and assign them to different
                        [Customer
                        Groups](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v2/#customer-groups).
                        The prices are specified exclusively at the variant
                        level. 


                        If an active Price List does not contain prices for a
                        variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The
                        association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be
                        done either via the Control Panel or using the [V2
                        Customer Groups API.](/api/v2/#customer-groups)


                        Price Lists will provide overridden price values to the
                        Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further
                        customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price
                        Object](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/price-object-properties)
                        in Stencil for further documentation.

                        - Bulk Pricing Tiers may additionally be associated with
                        a Price Record to indicate different pricing as the
                        quantity in cart increases.
                          
                        - If a variant has a `Price Record` any existing
                        product-level bulk pricing will not apply in the cart. 
                        For variants without `Price Records`, any existing
                        product bulk pricing will apply.

                        The Customer Login API enables single sign-on (SSO). It
                        allows your apps to programmatically log in a storefront
                        customer by using the login entry point URL:
                        `/login/token/{token}`. Here, {token} must be a JSON Web
                        Token (JWT) containing the parameters for the customer
                        login request, signed by your application’s Oauth client
                        secret.


                        Example use cases for the Customer Login API include:


                        * Integration with a SSO provider or IdP

                        * Continuous login between a BC storefront and another
                        system, such as a WordPress blog

                        * Any login method other than BC's typical email and
                        password login - for example, if you wanted to enable
                        customers to log in via a phone number and SMS password

                        ## JWT


                        JWT is a standard for verifying a login signature
                        between two parties. For a full overview of the JWT
                        standard, please see [JWT.IO](https://jwt.io/), where
                        you can find links to client libraries (in many
                        languages) that facilitate the generation and
                        verification of JWT tokens. BigCommerce also supplies
                        helper methods for generating login tokens in our [API
                        Client
                        Libraries](/api-docs/getting-started/about-api/new-subpage).


                        ### JWT Standard


                        A valid JWT token is a string composed of three parts,
                        separated by periods (“.”), which correspond to the
                        encoded header, the encoded payload, and the signature.

                        ### Payload

                        The payload contains a series of claims that identify
                        the application requesting the login, the store, and the
                        customer to be logged in. Optionally, you can specify a
                        redirect URL to direct the customer to a page other than
                        the My Account page after login. 


                        Once a request has is made with a given `jti`, it cannot
                        be made again. This parameter is used to prevent replay
                        attacks by malicious actors intercepting the request or
                        obtaining it after the fact.


                        The `request_ip` field can be used as an additional
                        security precaution, to prevent a malicious actor from
                        intercepting the request and making it from another
                        browser or system before you do. If you supply this
                        value, BigCommerce checks the incoming request to ensure
                        that it is being made from the stated IP address
                        otherwise the request fails. We strongly encourage
                        setting this IP address value, but doing so is optional,
                        to support those cases where this information is not
                        available.

                        libraries contain a method for generating a uuid. For
                        testing a [UUID
                        generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) can be used,
                        but it recommended to use built in libraries.|

                        | operation | string | Must contain the string

                        | redirect_to | string | Optional field containing a
                        relative path for the shopper's destination after login.
                        Will default to `/account.php`. |

                        | request_ip | string | Optional field containing the
                        expected IP address for the request. If provided,
                        BigCommerce will check that it matches the browser
                        trying to log in. If there is not a match, it will be
                        rejected |

                        ## Access URL

                        After generating the JWT token, your app should
                        immediately redirect the shopper’s browser to the
                        following access point URL to log the customer into

                        ## Logging in a Customer

                        The following tutorial will walk through creating a
                        login token. We recommend scripting this process since
                        the iat is invalid after 30 seconds. For the purpose of
                        illustration, this tutorial will walk through creating a
                        token manually using the debugger tool at JWT.io,
                        although doing so can be tricky due to time
                        constraints.  


                        **Prerequisites**:

                        Client ID and Client Secret generated from the store
                        with the scope set to [Customers Login]().

                        ### Create a JWT Token


                        1. Run a /GET request against the [Customers](http://)
                        resource (V2). Choose a customer and make note of the
                        customer_id.

                          If you are unsure how to make a /GET request see our
                          tutorial on [making your first request]().

                        3.  Add your Client Secret in the Verify Signature
                        Section. Replace the text `your-256-bit-secret` with the
                        Client Secret.

                        4. Copy the token from the encoded box and paste at the
                        end of the login/token url.

                        5. Paste the URL into the address bar.


                        If the request was successful then you will be logged in
                        as the customer and directed to /account.php. If it was
                        unsuccessful there will be a login attempt message and
                        you will be directed to /login.php

                        ## Troubleshooting


                        * If the server generating the iat is out of sync, the
                        login token will fail if the timestamp indicates a time
                        in the future or an expired token.


                        * The login URL can be visited only once. Once a GET
                        request is run against the link, the token is
                        invalidated. 


                        * Tokens can be validated or generated for testing
                        purposes using the debugger at https://jwt.io/.


                        * Tokens will be valid for a very short timeframe after
                        they are first generated, so tokens should not be
                        generated in advance. Instead, the application should
                        generate the token and then immediately redirect the
                        user’s browser to `/login/token/{token}`. If you're
                        seeing issues related to your system time differing from
                        BC's server time, you can use the <a
                        href="/api/v2/#get-a-timestamp">/v2/time</a> endpoint as
                        a source of truth.

                        ## Identifying Logged-In Customers Securely


                        If your application interacts dynamically with the
                        BigCommerce storefront, and conveys information that is
                        specific to a particular logged-in customer, you must
                        confirm that customer’s identity within the insecure
                        environment of the user’s browser.


                        To address this need, BigCommerce provides a Current
                        Customer endpoint, which your app can access via
                        JavaScript on the storefront. This endpoint returns a
                        JWT with identifying details about the customer. The
                        information is signed with your [OAuth client
                        secret](http://).

                        Below is example JavaScript that will access this JWT.
                        To test the JWT functionality, you can install this
                        JavaScript on your sandbox BigCommerce store. Your
                        application’s Client ID must be included in the request
                        (to identify the requesting application):

                        ## Storefront Cart and Checkout


                        The Storefront API's are for managing the contents of
                        managing a shopper's cart using JavaScript in the
                        context of a storefront session. 


                        ### When to Use the Storefront API's


                        * Analytics and Tracking

                        * Displaying data (see Fetch below)

                        * Needing to run a quick API call

                        * Quick Order Form


                        ### Using the Fetch API

                        The [Fetch
                        API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
                        is an alternative to
                        [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).
                        It uses less code and works well with CORS. You can use
                        the Fetch API to interact with the Storefront API's and
                        return a shoppers cart, checkout or order. If you are
                        using Internet Explorer, the Fetch API will not work. It
                        is recommended to use
                        [Polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) for Internet
                        Explorer 10+ and XMLHttpRequest for earlier versions.


                        Here we use `credentials: 'include'` to send them even
                        when doing a cross origin request.

                        You can also use the [Scripts API](http://) to add them
                        to a store in the footer section.

                        ## Server to Server Cart and Checkout


                        The Server to Server API's are for managing the contents
                        of shopping cart and checkout via OAuth. Using the Cart,
                        Checkout and Payment API this allows for a fully
                        headless ecommerce solution.


                        ### CaaS


                        Commerce-as-a-Service is possible with the Server to
                        Server API's. It allows for the underlying cart,
                        checkout, order and payment API's be called in a
                        seperate app. This mean using any framework you can make
                        API calls to lead a shopper through a custom experience
                        without having to use the BigCommerce front-end
                        checkout.


                        ## When to Use

                        * Modying cart contents such as price matching

                        * Taking a shopper through cart and checkout using an
                        app

                        * Quote Builder - Building a cart then restoring it on
                        the storefront

                        * Building custom apps

                        The Checkout JS SDK is a wrapper for the BigCommerce
                        Storefront Checkout API.


                        It allows for a developer to create a custom checkout
                        experience to move a customer through the checkout
                        process.

                        The SDK handles all the ‘heavy-lifting’ such as customer
                        login, getting shipping quotes and submitting payment
                        for an order.

                        With the Checkout JS SDK, you can build a [custom
                        checkout
                        presentation](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js-example)
                        layer in popular frontend frameworks such as React.

                        ## What Can I Do with the SDK?


                        -   It can initialize payment and shipping providers
                        that require client-side setup through a common
                        interface. Below are some examples of these providers:
                            
                            -   PayPal Express
                            -   Braintree
                            -   Stripe 
                            -   Square
                            -   Amazon
                            -   Klarna
                          
                        -   It provides a JavaScript interface for interacting
                        with the web API.
                            -   Fetch and submit resources:
                                -   Cart
                                -   Order
                                -   Customer
                            -   Fetch available options:
                                -   Shipping addresses
                                -   Shipping countries
                                -   Shipping states
                                -   Billing addresses
                                -   Billing countries
                                -   Billing states
                                -   Shipping methods
                                -   Payment methods
                         
                        The Checkout JS SDK allows you to present the checkout
                        process to the shopper in any way you like, and, through
                        frontend technologies and external web services, augment
                        the checkout with extra information. 


                        However, the Checkout JS SDK does not allow you to
                        change the underpinnings of the checkout - you must
                        still conform to the model of the Checkout API
                        underpinning the SDK to complete a Checkout and create
                        an Order in BigCommerce. 

                        The SDK does not allow you to implement custom payment,
                        shipping, or tax calculation providers into the checkout
                        - instead, the configured providers for these services
                        on a given store are expressed via our Checkout API.

                        BigCommerce has several ways to interact with orders. 
                        - Storefront Orders API 
                        - V2 Orders API

                        ##  Storefront Orders API 

                        Can be used to return order information right away to
                        the customer, for example, the confirmation screen or
                        scrape the data for analytics later. You can interact
                        with it either using an app or a browser API. 


                        Use the Fetch API to log orders to the console. See
                        [Storefront Orders API](http://) for more.

                        ## Server to Server Checkout Orders


                        This API will allow you to take a checkout made using a
                        call to the server and then convert that to an order.
                        From there the order can be managed by either working in
                        the Control Panel or using the V2 Orders API. [See
                        Server to Server Checkout](http://) for more.

                        This API can be used to create an order from scratch. It
                        allows you to manage an orders billing address,
                        products, coupons, and taxes. See [V2 Orders
                        API](http://) for more.

                        System Tax Codes, which identify products and services
                        that fall into special sales-tax categories. By using
                        these codes, merchants who subscribe to Avalara Premium
                        can calculate sales taxes more accurately.<br><br>
                        Stores without Avalara Premium will ignore the code when
                        calculating sales tax. Do not pass more than one code.
                        The codes are case-sensitive.<br><br> For details,

                        ### Notes 


                        You can filter the retrieved fields by appending one of
                        the following options to your request: 


                        - `?include=`

                        - `?include=@summary` 

                        - `?exclude=`


                        In particular, you can reduce payload size, and improve
                        performance, by excluding the `description` field.


                        ### Mandatory Fields 


                        However, the following fields are always present on
                        product API requests, and cannot be excluded:


                        - `id`

                        - `name`

                        - `date_modified`

                        - `primary_image`


                        ### include 


                        The following sample request will retrieve *only* the
                        specified `date_created`, `price`, and `cost_price`
                        fields, plus the [mandatory
                        fields](#get-a-product-mandatory) listed just above:


                        ```

                        https://store-et7xe3pz.mybigcommerce.com/api/v2/products/32?include=date_created,price,cost_price

                        The `?include=@summary` option retrieves the following
                        predefined subset of fields, in addition to the
                        [mandatory fields](#get-a-product-mandatory) listed
                        above: 


                        - `availability`

                        - `calculated_price`

                        - `inventory_tracking`

                        - `is_visible`

                        - `is_featured` 


                        Here is a sample request with the `?include=@summary`
                        option appended:

                        ### exclude 


                        The `?exclude=` option excludes one or more specified
                        fields. However, you cannot exclude the mandatory `id`,
                        `name`, `date_modified`, or `primary_image` fields.


                        Here is a sample request with the `?exclude=` option
                        appended:


                        ```

                        https://store-et7xe3pz.mybigcommerce.com/api/v2/products/32?exclude=description

                        ```


                        We have omitted the corresponding sample response.
                        However, the following section shows a complete sample
                        response for a request submitted with no `?include` or
                        `?exclude` option. (The effect of the
                        `?exclude=description` option shown above would be to
                        omit the `"description": ` field shown as the sixth
                        field below.)

                        ## Create a Product 


                        Creates a new product. The example request shows how to
                        create a basic product by sending a product object with
                        the minimum required properties.


                        > `POST /stores/{store_hash}/v2/products`


                        ### Read-only Properties 


                        The following properties of the product are read-only.
                        If one or more of these properties are included in the
                        request, it will be rejected.

                        #### Requirements 


                        The following properties of the product are required.
                        The request won’t be fulfilled unless these properties
                        are valid.


                        *   name

                        *   price

                        *   categories

                        *   availability

                        *   weight


                        ### Notes 


                        Create a request by sending a product object with the
                        minimum required properties:


                        ```

                        {
                            "name": "Plain T-Shirt",
                            "type": "physical",
                            "description": "This timeless fashion staple will never go out of style!",
                            "price": "29.99",
                            "categories": [18],
                            "availability": "available",
                            "weight": "0.5"
                        }

                        ```


                        When the `is_visible` property is not provided, the
                        product's visibility is `false` by default.


                        To make newly created products immediately visible on
                        the storefront, you must set `is_visible` to `true` when
                        you create each product.


                        To maximize system performance, BigCommerce caps the
                        number of categories to which a product can belong. The
                        maximum is 1,000. If your `POST` includes an array of
                        more than 1,000 `categories` ID values, BigCommerce will
                        return a 403 error:


                        ```

                        403 Access Denied/Forbidden

                        ```


                        If automatic tax is enabled on the store, the value of
                        `tax_class_id` will have no effect on the calculation of
                        taxes.

                        anchor: v2-create-a-product
                    - type: text
                      data: '---'

                        ### Read-only Properties 


                        The following properties of the product are read-only.
                        If one or more of these properties are included in the
                        request, it will be rejected.

                        *   options

                        *   tax_class


                        ### Requirements 


                        There are no required properties when updating a
                        product.


                        ### Notes 


                        To update a product, set one or more product properties
                        in the `PUT` request:


                        ```

                        {
                            "custom_url": "/plain-tshirt/",
                            "is_visible": true
                        }

                        ```


                        For example, you can use a `PUT` to link a product to an
                        option set:


                        ```

                        {
                            "option_set_id": 14
                        }

                        ```


                        Invalid property values will produce a `400 Bad Request`
                        error response:


                        ### Request 


                        ``` 

                        {
                            "condition": "Worn"
                        }

                        ```


                        #### Response 


                        ```

                        400 Bad Request

                        ```


                        Trying to set read-only properties will also produce a
                        `400 Bad Request` error response:


                        ### Request 


                        ```

                        {
                            "number_sold": 99
                        }

                        ```


                        ### Response 


                        ```

                        400 Bad Request

                        ```


                        To maximize system performance, BigCommerce caps the
                        maximum number of categories to which a product can
                        belong, at 1,000. If your `PUT` includes an array of
                        more than 1,000 `categories` ID values, BigCommerce will
                        return a `403` error:


                        ```

                        403 Access Denied/Forbidden

                        ```


                        If automatic tax is enabled on the store, the value of
                        `tax_class_id` will have no effect on the calculation of
                        taxes.

                        The following properties of the brand are read-only. If
                        one or more of these properties are included in the

                        ### Requirements 


                        The following properties of the brand are required. The
                        request won’t be fulfilled unless these properties are

                        ### Notes 


                        To maximize system performance, BigCommerce caps the
                        number of brands that can be added to a store at 30,000.
                        If your POST causes the store to exceed the maximum of
                        30,000 brands, BigCommerce will return a 403 error.


                        ### Request

                        The following properties of the discount rule are

                        category id, from lowest to highest.)

                        ### Filters 


                        Filter parameters can be added to the URL query string
                        to select specific categories in the collection.


                        | Parameter | Type | Example |

                        | --- | --- | --- |

                        | parent_id | string |
                        /api/v2/categories?parent_id={value} |

                        | name | string | /api/v2/categories?name={value} |

                        | is_visible | string |
                        /api/v2/categories?is_visible={value} |

                        | min_id | int | /api/v2/categories?min_id={value} |

                        | max_id | int | /api/v2/categories?max_id={value} |


                        ### Pagination 


                        Parameters can be added to the URL query string to
                        paginate the collection. The maximum limit is 250. If a
                        limit isn’t provided, up to 50 categories are returned
                        by default.


                        | Parameter | Type | Example |

                        | --- | --- | --- |

                        | Page | int | /api/v2/categories?page={number} |

                        | Limit | int | /api/v2/categories?limit={count} |

                        The following properties of the category are read-only.
                        If one or more of these properties are included in the
                        request, it will be rejected.

                        ### Requirements 


                        The following properties of the category are required.
                        The request won’t be fulfilled unless these properties
                        are valid.


                        *   name


                        ### Notes 


                        To maximize system performance, BigCommerce caps the
                        number of categories that can be added to a store at
                        16,000. If your `POST` causes the store to exceed the
                        maximum of 16,000 categories, BigCommerce will return a
                        403 error.


                        In addition, BigCommerce caps the total number of parent
                        categories at seven. If your `POST` includes the ID of a
                        parent category in the `parent_id` field, BigCommerce
                        will check that parent category and its parent and so on
                        to determine the total number of parent categories. If
                        your `POST` would cause the total number of parent
                        categories to exceed seven, BigCommerce will return a
                        403 error.


                        ### Request

                        ### Read-only Properties 


                        The following properties of the category are read-only.
                        If one or more of these properties are included in the
                        request, it will be rejected.

                        ### Requirements 


                        The following properties of the category are required.
                        The request won’t be fulfilled unless these properties
                        are valid.


                        ### Notes 


                        To maximize system performance, BigCommerce caps the
                        total number of parent categories at seven. If your
                        `PUT` includes the ID of a parent category in the
                        `parent_id` field, BigCommerce will check the parent and
                        any children of the current category to determine the
                        total number of parent categories. If your `PUT` would
                        cause the total number of parent categories to exceed
                        the maximum of seven, BigCommerce will return a 403
                        error.

                        ### Delete Products before Categories


                        The Delete All Categories operation will not succeed
                        unless the store has zero products. If any products in
                        the store belong to any categories, the entire operation
                        will fail. Therefore, if you really want to delete all
                        the categories of the store, you must first delete all
                        of the products in the store.
