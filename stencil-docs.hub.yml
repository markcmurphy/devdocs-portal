                        ## Choosing a Development Path


                        You have four increasingly hands-on options for
                        developing Stencil themes:

                        * Find a Design & Solutions Partner

                        * Light Customization – Graphical Theme Editor

                        * Light Customization – HTML/CSS

                        * Adapt a Stencil Theme, or Develop from Scratch



                        ###  Find a Design & Solutions Partner


                        If you prefer to have an expert collaborator customize
                        your theme, we recommend working with one of our
                        certified BigCommerce Design & Solutions Partners.

                        ### Light Customization – Graphical Theme Editor


                        A designer or store owner can customize many aspects of
                        an existing Stencil theme _without_ using specialized
                        development tools or techniques. Stencil's graphical
                        Theme Editor requires no coding at all. 


                        Yet Theme Editor still enables customization of a
                        theme's colors, typography, banners, headings, carousel,
                        and footer. It also enables customization of broader
                        layout characteristics, such as the number of products
                        displayed in various panels, category pages, and brand
                        pages.

                        ### Adapt a Stencil Theme, or Develop from Scratch


                        For complete control over a theme's appearance and logic
                        – including the ability to edit _all_ theme
                        configuration files – you will want to use the Stencil
                        CLI (command-line interface) framework. Stencil CLI is
                        described in detail in the remainder of this
                        documentation. 


                        To get up to speed on Stencil&#160;CLI's templating
                        conventions, please see the Quick Start sections just
                        below. Also see:


                        * [Getting Started with the Stencil
                        Framework](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwTYtMwfzbe7EZiIWPAmPtuwRHkY7BG-0)
                        (Videos)


                        ## Front-Matter Quick Start


                        Stencil templates start with a section of "front matter"
                        where you can flexibly, and concisely, customize each
                        page's design and layout details. For example, a couple
                        of keystrokes will allow you to change the number of
                        products that shoppers will see on a given page and
                        panel.


                        This front-matter section uses conventions from YAML, a
                        simple, widely used markup language. Even if you haven't
                        used these conventions before, our internal
                        documentation will help you rapidly master them:

                        Overview](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/using-yaml-front-matter)
                        of YAML syntax.



                        ## Handlebars Quick Start


                        Stencil uses the Handlebars templating language to
                        assemble dynamically changing content – drawn from the
                        BigCommerce store's catalog, and from other sources –
                        into the HTML pages displayed to shoppers. 


                        Handlebars' syntax is quite simple. It allows you to
                        accomplish powerful JavaScript operations with minimal
                        JavaScript code. To get up to speed on Handlebars
                        conventions, please see these third-party tutorials:

                        ## SEO Tips/Best Practices


                        Search-engine optimization (SEO) helps translate an
                        elegant theme into a successful, high-conversion
                        storefront. Because so many shoppers reach online stores
                        through a search engine, a search-optimized site will be
                        more visible – attracting more traffic. 


                        The Stencil framework is [designed for high SEO
                        performance](https://www.bigcommerce.com/improve-organic-traffic/).
                        However, you will want to keep SEO in mind as you build
                        out each theme and storefront. For guidelines, please

                        ## Blueprint-to-Stencil Features Map 


                        If you've been developing themes on BigCommerce's
                        longstanding Blueprint framework, you might be
                        wondering: Where did my stuff go? This section is
                        designed to help you identify the Stencil counterparts
                        to familiar Blueprint components.

Stencil CLI runs on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment. Installing Node.js also provides the required npmpackage manager.\n\n### More Info:\n* Node.js and npm prequisites\n* Installing Stencil CLI\n* Stencil CLI options\n\n## Attributes \n\nStencil's storefront template pages support YAML-formatted \"front matter\" to invoke the attributes you need, per page. Here is an example of a pagetop invocation to display a \"new products\" section, while limiting its contents to four products:\n\n```\n---\nproducts:\n    new:\n        limit: 4\n---\n```\n\n## More Info:\n* Attributes invocation overview\n* Attributes reference \n\n## Objects \n\nStencil exposes data objects that allow your themes to access various assets across a storefront. Here is an example of a Stencil object &ndash; a very simple one, which nevertheless references a second object:\n\nBrand List Object\n\n### More Info: \n\n  * Objects reference\n## Syntax \n\nTheme pages access Stencil objects using Handlebars, a lightweight, open-source templating language. Handlebars allows you to efficiently embed dynamic and conditional logic onto your storefront pages. A Handlebars expression begins with: {{ and ends with: }}\n\nBelow is a Handlebars if structure that tests for a boolean variable named product.similar_by_views. If its value is true, this snippet inserts a corresponding component &ndash; a carousel display of \"similar products.\" It also specifies a six-column display:\n\n```\n{{#if product.similar_by_views}}\n   {{> components/products/carousel products=product.similar_by_views columns=6}}\n{{/if}}\n```\n\n###  More Info: \n\n* Handlebars\n* Handlebars tutorial (requires Stencil installation)\n  \n## Event Hooks\n\nYour Stencil themes can access remote objects through data tags and event hooks, using the hooks to trigger defined events based on shopper behavior. To facilitate theme-building, BigCommerce provides the stencil-utils client-side JavaScript library for managing event hooks.\n\nIn the following code example from a Stencil theme, note the cart‑item‑add event. A theme could listen for this  event, to override the default form-submit behavior when a shopper adds product to their cart:\n\n```\n * Import all product-specific js \n */\n[...]\nimport utils from 'bigcommerce/stencil-utils';\n[...]\naddProductToCart() {\n    utils.hooks.on(<b>'cart-item-add'</b>, (event) =&gt; {\n        event.preventDefault();\n    });\n\t}\n```\n### More Info:\n* Event hooks reference\n* stencil-utils package introduction stencil-utils\n* API Reference\n\n## Design \n\nStencil supports Sass/SCSS upon installation, with your choice of framework.\n\n### More Info: \n* Components/Design Patterns\n"

                        The diagram below looks complex because it shows _all_
                        currently supported workflows for setting up Stencil.
                        However, for a typical initial setup – incorporating the
                        default Cornerstone reference theme – you would just
                        follow the black arrows straight down from top to
                        bottom.


                        Here are the color codes for each setup scenario, with
                        links to details about individual steps:


                        * Black: Basic initial setup, relying on default
                        Cornerstone theme. 

                        * Purple: Customize a theme downloaded from Theme
                        Marketplace (_other than_ Cornerstone). 

                        * Orange: Refresh Cornerstone from Theme Marketplace. 

                        * Green: Configure a custom JavaScript build system, to
                        avoid dependence on Webpack and jspm.

                        * Blue: Adds onto any of the preceding four scenarios.
                        If developing for a BigCommerce Blueprint production
                        store launched before Jan. 26, 2016, you must add one
                        extra step to enable Stencil in the store's control
                        panel.

                        ### Initial Cornerstone-Based Setup 


                        Start developing based on BigCommerce's default
                        Cornerstone theme. This is a streamlined workflow, using
                        Webpack as its JavaScript build system. Steps required:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Clone default Cornerstone theme

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Prepare Store and Tokens

                        * Proceed to Launching Stencil

                        ## Initial Cornerstone-Based Setup


                        Start developing based on BigCommerce's default
                        Cornerstone theme. This is a streamlined workflow, using
                        Webpack as its JavaScript build system. Steps required:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Clone default Cornerstone theme

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Prepare Store and Tokens

                        * Proceed to Launching Stencil


                        ## Cornerstone Refresh 


                        Download and install a new version of Cornerstone from
                        BigCommerce's Theme Marketplace. Steps required:


                        * Assume all prerequisites installed and Stencil CLI
                        installed

                        * Download fresh Cornerstone .zip

                        * Reinstall JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Repeat Launching Stencil


                        ## Downloaded Marketplace Theme 


                        Customize a theme (_other than_ Cornerstone, Diamond, or
                        Queen) downloaded from BigCommerce's Theme Marketplace.
                        This workflow requires BitBucket, and some earlier theme
                        versions require additional steps for the jspm
                        JavaScript build system. Steps required:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Set up BitBucket, download .zip, and install
                        JavaScript dependencies

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Prepare Store and Tokens

                        * Proceed to Launching Stencil


                        ## Custom JavaScript Build System 


                        Bypass Webpack (and jspm) by substituting a custom
                        JavaScript build system. Steps recommended:


                        * Install all prerequisites

                        * Install Stencil CLI

                        * Clone default Cornerstone theme

                        * Install JavaScript utilities with npm

                        * Configure your custom build system

                        * Prepare Store and Tokensstore-tokens)

                        * Proceed to Launching Stencil


                        ## Blueprint Store Launched before 1/26/2016 


                        Enable Stencil development on a BigCommerce production
                        store that was launched with a Blueprint theme before
                        Jan. 26, 2016. Steps required:

                          * Follow the installation path above that corresponds to your development scenario.
                          * As a separate (and simple) procedure, enable Stencil in the store's control panel.

                          workflow that bypasses BitBucket requirements, and
                          that replaces jspm with the Webpack build system. You
                          can configure Webpack's watched folders, or substitute

                        * If you have not yet added Cornerstone (or
                        Diamond/Queen) to your store, start at Themes
                        Marketplace and add the theme.
                            
                        Go to Storefront -> My Themes.


                        Unpack the zipped theme to a working directory.


                        (This can be the directory where you have been
                        developing your theme, or a new directory.)


                        Reinstalling Dependencies and Relaunching 


                        Ensure that your theme includes all current
                        dependencies, by repeating JavaScript
                        Utilitiesinstallation.
                          
                        Repeat the steps listed in the Launching Stencil
                        subsection


                        Next, ensure that your theme includes all current
                        dependencies by re-running npm, as follows:


                        Navigate to your theme directory. This example assumes
                        that this target directory has the default name stencil


                        `cd stencil`


                        `npm install`


                        You are now ready to resume development of your theme.
                        Please proceed to Launching Stencil


                        Later, when you are ready to upload your customized
                        theme to a store, you should follow the zipping and

                        How best to set up your customized Stencil theme to
                        smoothly incorporate future updates in its base theme?
                        We're gratefully sharing these guidelines from Ken
                        Utting, Web Developer for BigCommerce client
                        [goruck.com](https://www.goruck.com/). His scenario
                        (slightly edited here) addresses maintaining a single
                        custom theme that is based on a third-party Marketplace
                        theme. But&#160;these guidelines also apply to
                        maintaining one, or multiple, themes based on Stencil's
                        default Cornerstone theme.
                    - type: text
                      data: "## Best Practices for Handling Theme Updates\n\nWe've made significant changes to our theme, and one principle that I've found successful is isolating my changes as much as possible. I try to put my changes into their own files, whether they're changes to templates, JavaScript, or SCSS. \n\nI also name all my files, CSS classes and identifiers, and JavaScript methods and classes with a `gr-` prefix (as an abbreviation for our company, GORUCK LLC). Also, any changes I make to standard theme files are identified with a comment, such as: \n\n`Go Ruck Customization`\n\t\t\nFor example, I have a file in `assets/scss/` named `gr-theme.scss`. All of the styles I've added to the theme are either in this file, or imported by this file. So for styling, my only changes to the theme itself are in a handful of places where I had to change an existing theme style (identified with a comment), plus this one line in `templates/layout/base.html`:\n\n`{{{stylesheet '/assets/css/gr-theme.css'}}}`\n\nI've found that this approach provides several advantages: \n\n* It makes it easier to distinguish my custom code from code supplied by the default theme.\n* It makes it less likely that my code will get intermingled with the standard theme code. This, in turn, prevents my code from unexpectedly being affected by theme updates.\n* It makes it easier to merge base-theme updates into my theme code.\n\n##### Comparing and Merging Apples to Apples\n\nHaving isolated my changes as much as I can, I identify theme changes by comparing stock (base) themes, rather than by comparing base themes to my customized theme. When a new version of the theme is released, I download the .zip file from the BigCommerce control panel. \n\nI then use a desktop diff tool (Beyond Compare) to \ncompare the new version to the .zip file of the theme's previous release. I ignore changes in the .zip file's\n `meta/` and `parsed/` folders, and to its `manifest.json`, and do a `Compare Contents` on the rest of the files.\n\nUltimately, I need to examine the changes carefully, to identify any changes that might affect, or be affected by, my customizations. And I need to test thoroughly. But comparing the stock themes to each other reduces the number of changes I have to examine. \n\nAlso, because I isolate my changes, most of the theme changes can be copied directly into the corresponding file in my customized theme. In practice, this means that I can limit my testing to the areas affected by changes in the standard theme, rather than having to re-test all my own changes.\n\nI personally find that it is also helpful to migrate *every* theme update into my customized version, as the update is released. If I were to wait, and to allow changes to accumulate and become more substantial, I think it would be more difficult to adequately test – and correctly integrate – the changes. Similarly, I'm grateful to the developer of our base theme (Pixel Union) for updates that have always made small, incremental changes.\n\n##### Dynamic Content Injection\n\nFinally, we've also come up with a variety of techniques for dynamically placing content on a page. For example, we can dynamically add tabs to a product page, using content stored on our WebDAV. Similarly, we can inject content from an external file into the body of a page. This allows us to put something that appears in many places, like a sizing chart, in a single place where it can be easily updated. \n\nOr, we can use the BigCommerce control panel's various HTML editors – for Products, Categories, and Content > Web Pages – to inject content into predefined \"dropzones\" (custom div's). This allows us to generate a wide variety of content pages using a single custom template.\n\nAll of these techniques move content out of the theme, minimizing the complexity of merging base-theme updates into our customized theme. For details on how we use them, please see Dynamic Content Rendering on Stencil Storefronts."

                        ## Webpack, jspm, or Other JavaScript Managers


                        Stencil themes are Node.js applications, and therefore
                        contain dependencies on other JavaScript libraries. For
                        Stencil's default Cornerstone theme, we provide the
                        [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) build manager
                        to handle these dependencies. 


                        As you develop a theme based on Cornerstone, you have
                        options to reconfigure Webpack's watched folders, and to
                        even substitute a different build system. These options
                        are explained below.


                        All themes currently in the BigCommerce Theme
                        Marketplace use Webpack. However, older versions of
                        certain themes used the jspm JavaScript dependency
                        manager instead of Webpack. Please see this page to
                        determine (by version number) whether you are developing
                        based on one of these earlier versions, and to find the
                        required jspm setup procedures.

                        ## Webpack-Specific Configuration


                        The following Webpack configuration options can aid in
                        troubleshooting.


                        ### More-Verbose JavaScript Diagnostics


                        If JavaScript errors in your browser's developer tools
                        are not reporting filenames and line numbers, try
                        changing your `webpack.conf.js` file's
                        [sourcemap](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#devtool)
                        entry from:


                        ```

                        devtool: 'source-map'

                        ```

                        to:


                        ```

                        devtool: 'eval-source-map'

                        ```


                        The `eval-source-map` option is slower, but more
                        verbose. This [Webpack Devtool
                        Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
                        article provides an overview of all devtool options and
                        details regarding each.



                        ## Build-System Configuration File


                        To take advantage of automatic JavaScript bundling and
                        browser refresh, Stencil themes require the
                        [`stencil.conf.js`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/stencil.conf.js)
                        file. To enable a custom build system, you would need to
                        edit this file.


                        Within `stencil.conf.js`, Stencil CLI looks for the
                        exported `watchOptions` object, and `development` and
                        `production` callbacks, shown below. 


                        Let's take a closer look at each of these three
                        references.


                        ## Watched Folders: watchOptions Object


                        The `watchOptions` object defines directories for the
                        [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/docs) preview
                        engine to watch or ignore, in two respective lists. You
                        are free to edit these lists:


                        ```

                        /**
                         * Watch options for the core watcher
                         * @type {{files: string[], ignored: string[]}}
                         */
                        var watchOptions = {
                            // If files in these directories change, reload the page.
                            files: [
                                '/templates',
                                '/lang'
                            ],

                            //Do not watch files in these directories
                             ignored: [
                                '/assets/scss',
                                '/assets/less',
                                '/assets/css',
                                '/assets/dist',
                            ]
                        };

                        ```


                        ## JavaScript Rebundling: development Function


                        Upon the command-line instruction [`stencil
                        start`](/docs/running-stencil-locally), Stencil CLI will
                        look for and call the `development` function. 


                        In the base Cornerstone theme, we have created a Webpack
                        watcher to trigger a browser reload whenever theme edits
                        cause JavaScript to be rebundled to the theme's
                        `bundle.js` file. This watcher uses options configured
                        in the [webpack.conf.js
                        file](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/webpack.conf.js)
                        passed by `webpackConfig`. So a JavaScript rebuild will
                        refresh the browser:


                        ```

                        function development() {
                            webpack(webpackConfig).watch({}, err => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                }

                                process.send('reload');
                            });
                        }

                        ```


                        ## Theme Packaging: production Function 


                        When you issue the command-line instruction [`stencil
                        bundle`](/docs/bundling-submitting#ship-zip-small), to
                        process and package a completed theme for upload to a
                        store, Stencil CLI will look for and call the
                        `production` function. This function passes a callback
                        as its first argument, to support asynchronous builds. 


                        The callback must be invoked somewhere inside the
                        `production` function, to notify Stencil CLI that the
                        theme-specific build has completed and is ready to
                        package:


                        ```

                        function production() {
                            webpackConfig.watch = false;
                            webpackConfig.devtool = false;
                            webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
                                minimize: true,
                            }));
                            webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
                                comments: false,
                                compress: {
                                    warnings: true,
                                },
                                sourceMap: false, // Toggle to turn on source maps.
                            }));

                            webpack(webpackConfig).run(err => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err.message, err.details);
                                    throw err;
                                }

                                process.send('done');
                            });
                        }


                        if (process.send) {
                            // running as a forked worker

                        ### {{itemAt}}


                        _Block helper that returns the item at the specified
                        index._


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `idx` {Number}

                        * `returns` {any} `value`


                        #### Example


                        Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:


                        ```

                        {{itemAt array 1}}

                        //=> 'b'


                        ```


                        ### {{join}}


                        The `join` helper is custom to Stencil. It joins an
                        array of string items, with separators. It returns a
                        string. 


                        #### Parameters


                        - `values`: {Array}

                        - `separator`: {String}

                        - `limit=<number>`: An optional limit.


                        ### {{limit}}


                        The `limit` helper is custom to Stencil. It limits the
                        number of items returned from an array variable, and
                        returns a new array.


                        #### Parameters


                        - `data`: {Array}

                        - `limit`: {Number}


                        #### {{limit}} Example 


                        Assume that `{{cart.items}}` would return 10 items. You
                        could use this helper to limit that behavior to only the
                        first four items, by specifying: 


                        ```

                        {{limit cart.items 4}}

                        ```


                        ### {{pluck}}


                        The `pluck` helper is custom to Stencil. For one or more
                        specified search key(s), it retrieves corresponding
                        values from some or all elements in a specified
                        collection. 


                        The `pluck` helper returns the retrieved values in a
                        comma-separated string. This helper's general form is:


                        ```

                        {{pluck ([limit] <collection> [<limit-value>])
                        '<search-key>'}}

                        ```


                        #### Parameters


                        - `limit`, `limit-value`: Optional parameters to limit
                        the number of results returned.

                        - `collection`: The collection to search.

                        - `search-key`: The string to search for.



                        #### {{pluck}} Example 1


                        Assume that the `categories` collection contains:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware" },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'name'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return:


                        ```

                        "Bakeware,Cookware"

                        ```


                        #### {{pluck}} Example 2


                        If the `categories` themselves each contained an image
                        object, then you could use dot notation to access that
                        image object's children:


                        ```

                        categories: [
                          { "id": 1, "name": "Bakeware", "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Bakeware image"} },
                          { "id": 2, "name": "Cookware" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cookware image"} },
                          { "id": 3, "name": "Cutlery" "image": { "data": "http://...", "alt": "Cutlery image"} }
                        ]

                        ```


                        In this case, this Handlebars statement:


                        ```

                        {{pluck (limit categories 2) 'image.data'}}

                        ```


                        ...would return a comma-separated list of image URLs.

                        ```


                        ### {{forEach}}


                        Iterates over each item in an array, and exposes the
                        current item in the array as context to the inner block.
                        In addition to the current array item, the helper
                        exposes the following variables to the inner block:


                        * `index`

                        * `total`

                        * `isFirst`

                        * `isLast`


                        Also, `@index` is exposed as a private variable, and
                        additional private variables may be defined as hash
                        arguments.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `returns` {String}


                        #### Example


                        ```js

                        {'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'},

                        {'name': 'Malcolm', 'email': 'malcolm@example.com'},

                        {'name': 'David', 'email': 'david@example.com'}

                        ];


                        // example usage

                        // {{#forEach accounts}}

                        //   <a href="mailto:{{ email }}" title="Send an email
                        to {{ name }}">

                        //     {{ name }}

                        //   </a>{{#unless isLast}}, {{/unless}}

                        // {{/forEach}}

                        ```


                        ### {{inArray}}


                        Block helper that renders the block if an array has the
                        given `value`. Optionally, you can specify an inverse
                        block to render when the array does not have the given
                        value.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `value` {any}

                        * `options` {Object}

                        * `returns` {String}


                        #### Example


                        Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:


                        ```handlebars

                        {{#inArray array "d"}}
                          foo
                        {{else}}
                          bar
                        {{/inArray}}

                        //=> 'bar'

                        ```


                        ### {{isArray}}


                        Returns true if `value` is an es5 array.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `value` {any}: The value to test.

                        * `returns` {Boolean}


                        #### Example


                        ```handlebars

                        {{isArray "abc"}}

                        //=> 'false'

                        ```


                        ### <a name="last"></a> {{last}}


                        Returns the last item, or last `n` items, of an array.
                        Opposite of [first](#first).


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `n` {Number}: Number of items to return, starting with
                        the last item.

                        * `returns` {Array}


                        #### Example


                        Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`:


                        ```handlebars

                        {{last array 2}}

                        //=> '["d", "e"]'

                        ```


                        ### {{lengthEqual}}


                        Block helper that compares the length of the given array
                        to the number passed as the second argument. If the
                        array length is equal to the given `length`, the block
                        is returned. Otherwise, you have the option of returning
                        an inverse block.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}

                        * `length` {Number}

                        * `options` {Object}

                        * `returns` {String}


                        #### Example

                        //=> 'BBB'

                        ```


                        ### {{map}}


                        Returns a new array, created by calling `function` on
                        each element of the given `array`.

                        function double(str) {
                          return str + str;
                        }

                        // then used like this:

                        // {{map array double}}

                        //=> '["aa", "bb", "cc"]'

                          Render me if the array has a string.
                        {{else}}
                          Render me if it doesn't.

                        Sorts the given `array`. If an array of objects is
                        passed, you may optionally pass (as the second argument)
                        a `key` to sort on. Alternatively, you may pass a
                        sorting function as the second argument.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}: The array to sort.

                        * `key` {String|Function}: The object key to sort by, or
                        a sorting function.


                        #### Example


                        Given an array `['b', 'a', 'c']`:



                        ```handlebars

                        {{sort array}}

                        //=> '["a", "b", "c"]'

                        ```


                        ### {{sortBy}}


                        Sorts an `array`. If an array of objects is passed, you
                        may optionally pass a `key` to sort on as the second
                        argument. You may alternatively pass a sorting function
                        as the second argument.


                        #### Parameters


                        * `array` {Array}: The array to sort.

                        * `props` {String|Function}: One or more properties to
                        sort by, or sorting functions to use.

                                    example below displays the global
                                    `{{products.featured}}` object on the
                                    `<theme-name>/templates/pages/home.html`
                                    page template.


                                    First, to declare the object, the following
                                    [front
                                    matter](/docs/using-yaml-front-matter) must
                                    be placed at the top of this template. This
                                    particular declaration also limits the
                                    number of featured products to be displayed:


                                    ```

                                    ---

                                    products:
                                        [...]
                                        featured:
                                            limit: {{theme_settings.homepage_featured_products_count}}
                                    ---

                                    ```

                                    The `homepage_featured_products_count` limit
                                    is one of two relevant variables defined in
                                    Cornerstone's
                                    [`config.json`&#160;file](/docs/configjson-reference),
                                    here:


                                    ```
                                      "settings": {
                                        [...]
                                        "homepage_featured_products_count": 8,
                                        [...]

                                        [...]    
                                    ```


                                    In the body of the `home.html` template, the
                                    following Handlebars conditional statement
                                    displays the featured-products object
                                    declared above:


                                    ```
                                        {{#if products.featured}}
                                            {{> components/products/featured products=products.featured columns=theme_settings.homepage_featured_products_column_count}}

                                    ```


                                    This statement formats the featured-products
                                    display according to the

            # Welcome to the BigCommerce Stencil Developer Documentation


            Stencil is a new approach to theme and front-end development on the
            BigCommerce platform. This theming engine allows you to create
            beautiful, dynamic, and powerful storefronts.


            You can offer merchants multiple variations on each theme. You can
            also provide options for merchants to customize their storefront's
            look and feel, with no coding.

            ## Stencil Framework and Components


            Stencil provides certain key components for both theme developers
            and merchants. These are summarized in this diagram, and are fully
            described in the remainder of this documentation.


            These key components are:


            * Stencil Framework (Stencil CLI): The Stencil CLI framework enables
            developers to design and iterate themes locally, with full access to
            all assets – but with no impact on the merchant's live storefront.

            * Theme Marketplaces:Third-party marketplaces like ThemeForest
            enable developers to distribute themes to multiple merchants.

            * Theme Editor:This graphical, browser-based tool enables merchants
            to rapidly customize their themes' look and feel – and their
            storefront's function – with no coding. Theme developers'
            configuration choices determine which theme aspects merchants can
            customize, with what range of choices.)

            * Storefront:Merchants acquire themes, apply them to their
            storefronts, and customize them – creating an elegant user
            experience that resonates with their brand, and makes it easy for
            customers to find and purchase the products they want.
