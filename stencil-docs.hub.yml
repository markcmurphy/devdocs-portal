We're gratefully sharing these guidelines from Ken Utting, Web Developer for BigCommerce client [goruck.com](https://www.goruck.com/). His scenario (slightly edited here) addresses maintaining a single custom theme that is based on a third-party Marketplace theme. But&#160;these guidelines also apply to maintaining one, or multiple, themes based on Stencil's default Cornerstone theme."

                        "data": "## Best Practices for Handling Theme Updates\n\nWe've made significant changes to our theme, and one principle that I've found successful is isolating my changes as much as possible. I try to put my changes into their own files, whether they're changes to templates, JavaScript, or SCSS. \n\nI also name all my files, CSS classes and identifiers, and JavaScript methods and classes with a `gr-` prefix (as an abbreviation for our company, GORUCK LLC). Also, any changes I make to standard theme files are identified with a comment, such as: \n\n`Go Ruck Customization`\n\t\t\nFor example, I have a file in `assets/scss/` named `gr-theme.scss`. All of the styles I've added to the theme are either in this file, or imported by this file. So for styling, my only changes to the theme itself are in a handful of places where I had to change an existing theme style (identified with a comment), plus this one line in `templates/layout/base.html`:\n\n`{{{stylesheet '/assets/css/gr-theme.css'}}}`\n\nI've found that this approach provides several advantages: \n\n* It makes it easier to distinguish my custom code from code supplied by the default theme.\n* It makes it less likely that my code will get intermingled with the standard theme code. This, in turn, prevents my code from unexpectedly being affected by theme updates.\n* It makes it easier to merge base-theme updates into my theme code.\n\n##### Comparing and Merging Apples to Apples\n\nHaving isolated my changes as much as I can, I identify theme changes by comparing stock (base) themes, rather than by comparing base themes to my customized theme. When a new version of the theme is released, I download the .zip file from the BigCommerce control panel. \n\nI then use a desktop diff tool (Beyond Compare) to \ncompare the new version to the .zip file of the theme's previous release. I ignore changes in the .zip file's\n `meta/` and `parsed/` folders, and to its `manifest.json`, and do a `Compare Contents` on the rest of the files.\n\nUltimately, I need to examine the changes carefully, to identify any changes that might affect, or be affected by, my customizations. And I need to test thoroughly. But comparing the stock themes to each other reduces the number of changes I have to examine. \n\nAlso, because I isolate my changes, most of the theme changes can be copied directly into the corresponding file in my customized theme. In practice, this means that I can limit my testing to the areas affected by changes in the standard theme, rather than having to re-test all my own changes.\n\nI personally find that it is also helpful to migrate *every* theme update into my customized version, as the update is released. If I were to wait, and to allow changes to accumulate and become more substantial, I think it would be more difficult to adequately test – and correctly integrate – the changes. Similarly, I'm grateful to the developer of our base theme (Pixel Union) for updates that have always made small, incremental changes.\n\n##### Dynamic Content Injection\n\nFinally, we've also come up with a variety of techniques for dynamically placing content on a page. For example, we can dynamically add tabs to a product page, using content stored on our WebDAV. Similarly, we can inject content from an external file into the body of a page. This allows us to put something that appears in many places, like a sizing chart, in a single place where it can be easily updated. \n\nOr, we can use the BigCommerce control panel's various HTML editors – for Products, Categories, and Content > Web Pages – to inject content into predefined \"dropzones\" (custom div's). This allows us to generate a wide variety of content pages using a single custom template.\n\nAll of these techniques move content out of the theme, minimizing the complexity of merging base-theme updates into our customized theme. For details on how we use them, please see Dynamic Content Rendering on Stencil Storefronts."

These options are explained below.\n\nAll themes currently in the BigCommerce Theme Marketplace use Webpack. However, older versions of certain themes used the jspm JavaScript dependency manager instead of Webpack. Please see this page to determine (by version number) whether you are developing based on one of these earlier versions, and to find the required jspm setup procedures."

                        "data": "## Webpack-Specific Configuration\n\nThe following Webpack configuration options can aid in troubleshooting.\n\n### More-Verbose JavaScript Diagnostics\n\nIf JavaScript errors in your browser's developer tools are not reporting filenames and line numbers, try changing your `webpack.conf.js` file's [sourcemap](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#devtool) entry from:\n\n```\ndevtool: 'source-map'\n```\nto:\n\n```\ndevtool: 'eval-source-map'\n```\n\nThe `eval-source-map` option is slower, but more verbose. This [Webpack Devtool Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) article provides an overview of all devtool options and details regarding each.\n\n\n## Build-System Configuration File\n\nTo take advantage of automatic JavaScript bundling and browser refresh, Stencil themes require the [`stencil.conf.js`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/stencil.conf.js) file. To enable a custom build system, you would need to edit this file.\n\nWithin `stencil.conf.js`, Stencil CLI looks for the exported `watchOptions` object, and `development` and `production` callbacks, shown below. \n\nLet's take a closer look at each of these three references.\n\n## Watched Folders: watchOptions Object\n\nThe `watchOptions` object defines directories for the [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/docs) preview engine to watch or ignore, in two respective lists. You are free to edit these lists:\n\n```\n/**\n * Watch options for the core watcher\n * @type {{files: string[], ignored: string[]}}\n */\nvar watchOptions = {\n    // If files in these directories change, reload the page.\n    files: [\n        '/templates',\n        '/lang'\n    ],\n\n    //Do not watch files in these directories\n     ignored: [\n        '/assets/scss',\n        '/assets/less',\n        '/assets/css',\n        '/assets/dist',\n    ]\n};\n```\n\n## JavaScript Rebundling: development Function\n\nUpon the command-line instruction `stencil start`, Stencil CLI will look for and call the `development` function. \n\nIn the base Cornerstone theme, we have created a Webpack watcher to trigger a browser reload whenever theme edits cause JavaScript to be rebundled to the theme's `bundle.js` file. This watcher uses options configured in the webpack.conf.js file passed by `webpackConfig`. So a JavaScript rebuild will refresh the browser:\n\n```\nfunction development() {\n    webpack(webpackConfig).watch({}, err => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(err.message, err.details);\n        }\n\n        process.send('reload');\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Theme Packaging: production Function \n\nWhen you issue the command-line instruction `stencil bundle`, to process and package a completed theme for upload to a store, Stencil CLI will look for and call the `production` function. This function passes a callback as its first argument, to support asynchronous builds. \n\nThe callback must be invoked somewhere inside the `production` function, to notify Stencil CLI that the theme-specific build has completed and is ready to package:\n\n```\nfunction production() {\n    webpackConfig.watch = false;\n    webpackConfig.devtool = false;\n    webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({\n        minimize: true,\n    }));\n    webpackConfig.plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({\n        comments: false,\n        compress: {\n            warnings: true,\n        },\n        sourceMap: false, // Toggle to turn on source maps.\n    }));\n\n    webpack(webpackConfig).run(err => {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(err.message, err.details);\n            throw err;\n        }\n\n        process.send('done');\n    });\n}\n\nif (process.send) {\n    // running as a forked worker\n    process.on('message', message => {\n        if (message === 'development') {\n            development();\n        }\n\n        if (message === 'production') {\n            production();\n        }\n    });\n\n    process.send('ready');\n}\n```"

                        "data": "## {{itemAt}}\n\n_Block helper that returns the item at the specified index._\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `idx` {Number}\n* `returns` {any} `value`\n\n#### {{itemAt}} Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```\n{{itemAt array 1}}\n//=> 'b'\n\n```\n---\n\n## {{join}}\n\nThe `join` helper is custom to Stencil. It joins an array of string items, with separators. It returns a string. \n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `values`: {Array}\n- `separator`: {String}\n- `limit=<number>`: An optional limit.\n\n#### {{join}} Example\n\ninsert join example\n\n---\n\n### {{limit}}\n\nThe `limit` helper is custom to Stencil. It limits the number of items returned from an array variable, and returns a new array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `data`: {Array}\n- `limit`: {Number}\n\n#### {{limit}} Example \n\nAssume that `{{cart.items}}` would return 10 items. You could use this helper to limit that behavior to only the first four items, by specifying: \n\n```\n{{limit cart.items 4}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{pluck}}\n\nThe `pluck` helper is custom to Stencil. For one or more specified search key(s), it retrieves corresponding values from some or all elements in a specified collection. \n\nThe `pluck` helper returns the retrieved values in a comma-separated string. This helper's general form is:\n\n```\n{{pluck ([limit] <collection> [<limit-value>]) '<search-key>'}}\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `limit`, `limit-value`: Optional parameters to limit the number of results returned.\n- `collection`: The collection to search.\n- `search-key`: The string to search for.\n\n\n#### {{pluck}} Example 1\n\nAssume that the `categories` collection contains:\n\n```\ncategories: [\n  { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Bakeware\" },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cookware\" },\n  { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Cutlery\" }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, this Handlebars statement:\n\n```\n{{pluck (limit categories 2) 'name'}}\n```\n\n...would return:\n\n```\n\"Bakeware,Cookware\"\n```\n\n#### {{pluck}} Example 2\n\nIf the `categories` themselves each contained an image object, then you could use dot notation to access that image object's children:\n\n```\ncategories: [\n  { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Bakeware\", \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Bakeware image\"} },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cookware\" \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Cookware image\"} },\n  { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Cutlery\" \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Cutlery image\"} }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, this Handlebars statement:\n\n```\n{{pluck (limit categories 2) 'image.data'}}\n```\n\n...would return a comma-separated list of image URLs.\n\n---\n\n\n## <a name=\"array_std\"></a> Standard Array Helpers\n\nThe following standard array helpers are supported on the Stencil framework.\n\n### <a name=\"after\"></a> {{after}}\n\nReturns all of the items in an array after the specified index. Opposite of [before](#before).\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}: Collection.\n* `n` {Number}: Starting index (number of items to exclude).\n* `returns` {Array}: Array exluding `n` items.\n\n#### Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{after array 1}}\n//=> '[\"c\"]'\n```\n\n---\n\n## {{arrayify}}\n\nCasts the given `value` to an array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `value` {any}\n* `returns` {Array}\n\n#### {{arrayify}} Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{arrayify \"foo\"}}\n//=> '[\"foo\"]'\n```\n---\n\n## <a name=\"before\"></a> {{before}}\n\nReturns all of the items in the collection before the specified count. Opposite of [after](#after).\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `n` {Number}\n* `returns` {Array}: Array excluding items after the given number.\n\n#### {{before}} Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{before array 2}}\n//=> '[\"a\", \"b\"]'\n```\n\n---\n\n## {{eachIndex}}\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `options` {Object}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### {{eachIndex}} Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{#eachIndex collection}}\n  {{item}} is {{index}}\n{{/eachIndex}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{filter}}\n\nBlock helper that filters the given array.

In addition to the current array item, the helper exposes the following variables to the inner block:\n\n* `index`\n* `total`\n* `isFirst`\n* `isLast`\n\nAlso, `@index` is exposed as a private variable, and additional private variables may be defined as hash arguments.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### {{forEach}} Example\n\n```js\nvar accounts = [\n{'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'},\n{'name': 'Malcolm', 'email': 'malcolm@example.com'},\n{'name': 'David', 'email': 'david@example.com'}\n];\n\n// example usage\n// {{#forEach accounts}}\n//   <a href=\"mailto:{{ email }}\" title=\"Send an email to {{ name }}\">\n//     {{ name }}\n//   </a>{{#unless isLast}}, {{/unless}}\n// {{/forEach}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{inArray}}\n\nBlock helper that renders the block if an array has the given `value`. Optionally, you can specify an inverse block to render when the array does not have the given value.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `value` {any}\n* `options` {Object}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### {{inArray}} Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#inArray array \"d\"}}\n  foo\n{{else}}\n  bar\n{{/inArray}}\n//=> 'bar'\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{isArray}}\n\nReturns true if `value` is an es5 array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `value` {any}: The value to test.\n* `returns` {Boolean}\n\n#### Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{isArray \"abc\"}}\n//=> 'false'\n```\n\n### <a name=\"last\"></a> {{last}}\n\nReturns the last item, or last `n` items, of an array. Opposite of [first](#first).\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `n` {Number}: Number of items to return, starting with the last item.\n* `returns` {Array}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{last array 2}}\n//=> '[\"d\", \"e\"]'\n```\n\n### {{lengthEqual}}\n\nBlock helper that compares the length of the given array to the number passed as the second argument. If the array length is equal to the given `length`, the block is returned. Otherwise, you have the option of returning an inverse block.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `length` {Number}\n* `options` {Object}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#lengthEqual array 10}}AAA{{else}}BBB{{/lengthEqual}}\n//=> 'BBB'\n```\n\n### {{map}}\n\nReturns a new array, created by calling `function` on each element of the given `array`.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `fn` {Function}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven an array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```js\n// register `double` as a helper\nfunction double(str) {\n  return str + str;\n}\n// then used like this:\n// {{map array double}}\n//=> '[\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"]'\n```\n\n### {{some}}\n\nBlock helper that returns the block *if* the callback returns true for some value in the given array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `cb` {Function}: Callback function.\n* {Options}: Handlebars-provided options object.\n* `returns` {Array}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `[1, 'b', 3]`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#some array isString}}\n  Render me if the array has a string.\n{{else}}\n  Render me if it doesn't.\n{{/some}}\n//=> 'Render me if the array has a string.'\n```\n\n### {{sort}}\n\nSorts the given `array`.

Stencil engines the Cornerstone theme, which is the foundation a theme developer needs to quickly start developing premium, custom themes with Stencil. \n\nStencil makes it possible for themes to have multiple variations. Cornerstone comes with 3 variations: Cornerstone Light, Cornerstone Warm, and Cornerstone Bold.\n\nStencil also provides features that allow merchants to customize their storefront's look and feel with no coding, making Stencil a powerful and useful engine for all audiences."

Use the familiar Foundation framework (provided) or substitute your choice of framework.\n\nStencil's Cornerstone base theme uses a BigCommerce pattern library called Citadel, which is built on top of the ZURB Foundation framework, version 5.5.3. \n\nFoundation offers you the framework for creating a responsive theme. You have the option of swapping out Foundation for another framework, although doing so would require significant work.\n\nNotes about Citadel:\nCitadel extends Foundation’s mixins and components to provide Stencil’s own mixins, extensible components, and utilities. These include drop-down lists, forms, and similar resources.\nCitadel resources are named according to BEM and SUIT CSS conventions. Classes are named functionally, rather than based on visual presentation or content. Our style guide is published here.\nCitadel assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these Stencil subdirectories: \n<theme-name>/assets/scss/settings/citadel/ \n<theme-name>/assets/scss/components/citadel/\nNotes about Foundation:\nStencil specifically supports version 5.5.3 of Foundation. (Documentation here.)\nWe do not support Foundation 6.x, due to breaking changes introduced between versions 5.x and 6.x.\nFoundation assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these subdirectories: \n<theme-name>/assets/scss/settings/foundation/ \n<theme-name>/assets/scss/components/foundation/\nMore Info:\nFor more detailed information about the Citadel and Foundation SCSS components, and their naming conventions, please see Components/Design Patterns.\n\n\n---\n\n**Page-specific resource definition using YAML formatted front matter**\n\nSpecify the dynamic content you want to be displayed on your storefront pages with YAML formatted front matter.\n\n---\n\n**JavaScript event hooks**\n\nConfigure a Stencil theme to send notifications to merchants in order to collect product data and optimize a shopper's experience.\n\n---\n\n**Stencil Theme Editor**\n\nThe Stencil Theme Editor is a browser-based tool that enables merchants to rapidly customize a theme's look and feel with no coding. \n\nBigCommerce theme developers' configuration choices determine which theme aspects merchants can customize, and the range of choices for each aspect.\n\n---\n\n**Responsive, mobile-friendly themes**\n\nBigCommerce stores powered by Stencil allow shoppers to have a first class experience across any device.\n\n---\n\nThis list simply summarizes Stencil's core features. Continue reading through the Stencil Developer Documentation to learn all about Stencil's full capabilities."

BigCommerce will keep trying for a little over 48 hours. At the end of that time, BigCommerce sends an email to the email address set during app registration and disables the webhook by setting the is_active flag to false.\n\nYou can proactively check to make sure that everything is OK by periodically making a GET request and checking the is_active flag.\n\nIf you receive an email or discover that the is_active flag has been flipped to false, try the following:\n\nCheck to see if your app is responding to the event payload with something other than HTTP 200.\nCheck to make sure that your server has a valid TLS/SSL setup. One way to do this is by visiting the following website: https://sslcheck.globalsign.com. Any of the following will cause the TLS/SSL handshake to fail:\nSelf-signed certificate.\nHost name of the certificate does not match the server’s DNS.\nYour server’s key or trust store has not been loaded up with the intermediate certificates necessary to establish the chain of trust.\nOnce you have resolved the issue preventing the connection, send a PUT request to flip the is_active flag back to true. This will cause BigCommerce to start sending the event payloads to your callback URI again.\n\n### Why am I not receiving a 201 response after creating a webhook?\nAfter sending a POST request to create a webhook, you should get an HTTP 201 back. If you do not, check your TLS/SSL setup and be sure that your request contains the following headers:\n\n```\n     Accept: application/json\n     Content-Type: application/json\n     X-Auth-Client: <the OAuth client id>\n     X-Auth-Token: <the OAuth token>\n```"
