## Tax Class

The Tax Class object, and endpoints, manage tax calculations applied to sales. Tax classes are used to apply different tax rates for specific types of products and orders. This API is read only. Classes must be set using the [Control Panel](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Taxes-Video#).

**Note**
- Default sorting is by tax-class id, from lowest to highest.
