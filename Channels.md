Introduction

## Channels

Create and manage product listings for multiple storefronts and sales channels. 

A channel is anywhere a merchant sells their products. This encompasses headless storefronts, marketplaces, POS systems, and marketing platforms.

### Channel Listings 

Manage catalog differences among different storefronts or marketplaces. 

Channel listings allow you to manage catalog differences among different storefronts or marketplaces.

### Sites and Routes

Sites and routes control the paths that make up a headless storefront. They ensure links point where they’re supposed to and sales are attributed correctly. For example, a shopper’s order confirmation email should link back to Storefront A, where they placed their order, not Storefront B, which they’ve never visited.

## Channel Sites

A site refers to the domain associated with a channel. 

## Channel Site Routes

Routes point to the URLs for key pages on the headless storefront. They define where your homepage is, where your cart page is, etc.
