Introduction

## Channels

Create and manage product listings for multiple storefronts and sales channels. 

A channel is anywhere a merchant sells their products. This encompasses headless storefronts, marketplaces, POS systems, and marketing platforms.

### Sites and Routes

Sites and routes control the paths that make up a headless storefront. They ensure links point where they’re supposed to and sales are attributed correctly. For example, a shopper’s order confirmation email should link back to Storefront A, where they placed their order, not Storefront B, which they’ve never visited.

## Channel Listings 

Manage catalog differences among different storefronts or marketplaces.

## Channel Site Routes
