### Variations
For more information on variations, see the [Product Variants](#) page.

### Customizations
Customizations are used to modify products (or variants) and provide a way to conditionally change their price or weight. For example, if you sell personalized products, you might include a checkbox that adds $5 if shoppers want to add their name, and a text field so they can enter it.

Customizations are used to modify existing products or variants, not to generate new ones, so they do not have SKUs or stock. They can be required or optional.
