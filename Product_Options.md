## Product Options 
Product Options allow you to sell items that come in several variations, like different colors or sizes. They also provide a way for your customers to customize or modify products, like a text field to include a name for personalization, or a checkbox to add an optional insurance fee.

### Variations
For more information on variations, see the [Product Variants](#) page.

### Customizations
Customizations are used to modify products (or variants) and provide a way to conditionally change their price or weight. For example, if you sell personalized products, you might include a checkbox that adds $5 if shoppers want to add their name, and a text field so they can enter it.

Customizations are used to modify existing products or variants, not to generate new ones, so they do not have SKUs or stock. They can be required or optional.

The part of a customization option that a shopper interacts with is called a *modifier option* and can be things like a checkbox, text box, or a file upload button. If you want any of your modifier options to change the overall product price or weight when selected, then you can use a *Rule*.
