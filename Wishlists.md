## Wishlists

The Wishlist API allows a developer to create and manage customer [Wishlists](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Wishlists). A Wishlist allows you to see what your customers are interested in and saving on the store. With this information youâ€™ll be able to create targeted campaigns to help merchants grow their business.   Customer API OAuth scopes give you access to Wishlists API. See [OAuth Scopes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes).
