Introduction

## Creating carts

Use the [Server to Server Cart API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/storefront/carts) to create carts for existing customers and guest customers.

### Guest cart

A guest cart assumes the shopper is not a customer and is not logging in or creating an account during checkout. Handle guest checkouts by displaying the cart data to the customer and then moving them to Checkout using the Checkout API.

## Redirecting to checkout

When creating a cart, there is an optional query to create a redirect URL. Use this to redirect the shopper to a BigCommerce hosted checkout page.
