## Scripts

The BigCommerce Scripts API gives developers the ability to inject scripts into a store's template files programmatically. This means that app and integrations can insert scripts into a userâ€™s storefront without requiring the user to manually paste a snippet of code into their control panel. There are many use cases for this powerful API, for example:
* inserting analytics scripts
* inserting single-click app scripts
* inserting live chat and support plugins
* inserting theme extensions or connector apps
