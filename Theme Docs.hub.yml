Or moving to the Stencil templating environment from a pure HTML and CSS-based design?\n\nYou have four (non-mutually exclusive) options for developing Stencil themes:\n\n* Find a Design & Solutions Partner\n* Light Customization using the Theme Editor\n* Light Customization using HTML and CSS\n* Adapting a Stencil Theme or Developing from Scratch\n\n###  Find a Design & Solutions Partner\n\nIf you prefer to have an expert collaborator customize your theme, we recommend working with one of our certified BigCommerce Design & Solutions Partners. Reference the following resources to do so:\n\n* [Partner Directory](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/search?i=75)\n* [Working with a Design Partner](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/Working-with-a-Design-Partner) (Support Guide)\n\n### Light Customization with Stencil Theme Editor\n\nStencil can be customized without the use of any specialized development tools or techniques by using of the Stencil Theme Editor. The Stencil Theme Editor still enables customization of a theme's colors, typography, banners, headings, carousel, and footer. It also enables customization of broader layout characteristics, such as the number of products displayed in various panels, category pages, and brand pages.\n\nFor details, please see:\n\n* [Theme Editor](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-the-Stencil-Theme-Editor/) (Support article)\n* [Stencil and the BigCommerce Control Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2F6F8LJXzs&list=PLwTYtMwfzbe7EZiIWPAmPtuwRHkY7BG-0&index=2) (Video introduction to Theme Editor)\n* [Changing Your Store's Theme](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/What-to-Consider-When-Changing-Your-Theme) (Support guide)\n* [Personalizing Your Theme](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/Personalizing-your-New-Theme) (Support guide)\n\n### Light Customization with HTML and CSS\n\nIf you are most comfortable working in HTML and CSS, Stencil's *Edit Theme Files* feature allows you to directly edit most of your theme's files from the Control Panel. For details, please see:\n\n* [Editing Stencil Theme Files](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Editing-Stencil-Theme-Files) (Support article)\n* [Getting Started with the Stencil Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waJ1dg_dAh8&index=11&list=PLwTYtMwfzbe7EZiIWPAmPtuwRHkY7BG-0) (Video overview of copying and editing a theme's files)\n\n### Adapt a Stencil Theme, or Develop from Scratch\n\nFor complete control over a theme's appearance and logic – including the ability to edit _all_ theme configuration files – you will want to use the Stencil Command-line interface, also known as the Stencil CLI.\n\nTo learn Stencil CLI's templating conventions, see Installing Stencil CLI.

Under OAuth Scopes, set the Themes selector to either modify or read-only.\n\n(The read-only scope is sufficient to authorize/initialize a Stencil theme. However, the modify scope will achieve the same goal, while also authorizing this account to upload themes to the store from the command line.)\n\n6. Click Save.

Cornerstone provides the standard file structure, base design pattern, and default file assets necessary to start developing a custom storefront experience.\n\nThe Cornerstone file structure consists of four main subdirectories. Within those subdirectories, you'll be directed to specific files in the Development Quick Start tutorial and in Stencil reference material:\n\n### `template/pages`\n`templates/pages` contains all the base template pages used in a BigCommerce online storefront. The pages are grouped by page category. In order to prevent any rendering errors, please avoid changing page names. For details, please see Templates Required Directory > Pages Subdirectory.\n\n\n### `template/components`\n`templates/components` Components consist of code snippets and partials that can be reused throughout your theme. This directory is grouped by component type. For details, please see Templates Required Directory > Component Subdirectory.\n\n### `template/layout`\n`templates/layout` define the overall structure (header, footer, etc.) for your storefront. You can implement multiple layouts here, for different use cases – to make it easy to switch between different look-and-feel variations for the same theme. For details, please see Templates Required Directory > Layout Subdirectory.\n\n### `assets/`\n`assets/` (images, CSS and JavaScript files) will be located in this directory. For details, please see CSS, JavaScript, and Design Resources.\n\n### `lang/`\n`lang/` contains translation files, including the required `en.json`. For details, please see the Internationalization/Localization section of the documentation.\n\nWhen developing in your local environment, all files that you change in your Stencil theme directory (/cornerstone/ in our default installation) will be reflected immediately at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n",

These guidelines can also apply to maintaining a custom theme based on Stencil's default Cornerstone theme.\n\n### Handling and Managing Theme Updates\n\n_We've made significant changes to our theme, and one principle that I've found successful is isolating my changes as much as possible. I try to put my changes into their own files, whether they're changes to templates, JavaScript, or SCSS._\n\n_I also name all my files, CSS classes and identifiers, and JavaScript methods and classes with a `gr-` prefix (as an abbreviation for our company, GORUCK LLC). Also, any changes I make to standard theme files are identified with a comment, such as:_\n\n`//Go Ruck Customization`\n\t\t\n_For example, I have a file in `assets/scss/` named `gr-theme.scss`. All of the styles I've added to the theme are either in this file, or imported by this file. So for styling, my only changes to the theme itself are in a handful of places where I had to change an existing theme style (identified with a comment), plus this one line in `templates/layout/base.html`:_\n\n`{{{stylesheet '/assets/css/gr-theme.css'}}}`\n\n_I've found that this approach provides several advantages:_\n\n* It makes it easier to distinguish my custom code from code supplied by the default theme.\n* It makes it less likely that my code will get intermingled with the standard theme code. This, in turn, prevents my code from unexpectedly being affected by theme updates.\n* It makes it easier to merge base-theme updates into my theme code.\n\n### Comparing and Merging Theme Updates\n\n_Having isolated my changes as much as I can, I identify theme changes and updates by comparing base themes, rather than by comparing base themes to my customized theme. When a new version of the theme is released, I download the .zip file from the BigCommerce Control Panel._\n\n_I then use a desktop diff tool (Beyond Compare) to \ncompare the new version to the .zip file of the theme's previous release. I ignore changes in the .zip file's\n `meta/` and `parsed/` folders, and to its `manifest.json`, and do a `Compare Contents` on the rest of the files._\n\nUltimately, I need to examine the changes carefully, to identify any changes that might affect, or be affected by, my customizations. And I need to test thoroughly. But comparing the stock themes to each other reduces the number of changes I have to examine. \n\nAlso, because I isolate my changes, most of the theme changes can be copied directly into the corresponding file in my customized theme. In practice, this means that I can limit my testing to the areas affected by changes in the standard theme, rather than having to re-test all my own changes.\n\nI personally find that it is also helpful to migrate *every* theme update into my customized version, as the update is released. If I were to wait, and to allow changes to accumulate and become more substantial, I think it would be more difficult to adequately test – and correctly integrate – the changes. Similarly, I'm grateful to the developer of our base theme (Pixel Union) for updates that have always made small, incremental changes.\n\n### Dynamic Content Injection\n\n_We've also come up with a variety of techniques for dynamically placing content on a page. For example, we can dynamically add tabs to a product page, using content stored on our WebDAV. Similarly, we can inject content from an external file into the body of a page. This allows us to put something that appears in many places, like a sizing chart, in a single place where it can be easily updated._\n\n_Or, we can use the BigCommerce control panel's various HTML editors – for Products, Categories, and Content > Web Pages – to inject content into predefined \"dropzones\" (custom div's). This allows us to generate a wide variety of content pages using a single custom template._\n\nAll of these techniques minimize the complexity of merging base-theme updates into our customized theme. For further details and examples on how we implement these techniques, see [Dynamic Content Rendering on Stencil Storefronts]()."

So, consider this handtooled approach:\n\nUse GitHub's Web interface to inspect each Cornerstone commit (change) of interest. Each commit will show you – for all changed files – a diff view highlighting any deletions (left/red) and any insertions (right/green).\n\nFor changes that you want to incorporate into your theme, access the source code.\n\nAs illustrated below, you can either access individual files via Github's Raw view, or you can download a .zip of the whole Cornerstone repo in order to access all files locally.\n\nManually edit the changes into your theme's affected files.\n\n### Accessing Individual Files\n\nIn the file-by-file approach: For each commit that you would like to incorporate into your custom theme, do the following for each of the commit's changed files.\n\nIn GitHub's diff view, click the View button at the upper right. (We show it highlighted with a red border and a tooltip.) You will see the file's full contents, as shown below.\n\nClick the Raw button at the upper right (which we show highlighted in red). This will reveal the file's full contents as plaintext – allowing you to copy and paste without picking up the table metadata used to display line numbering.\n\n### Downloading the Cornerstone Repository\n\nThis approach downloads all theme files at once, allowing you to copy/paste their relevant contents locally.\n\n1. Navigate to the [Cornerstone Github Repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone).\n2. On the right hand side of the page, click the green `Clone or download` button, and select Download ZIP.\n\n\n\n"

                        "data": "## {{itemAt}}\n\n_Block helper that returns the item at the specified index._\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `idx` {Number}\n* `returns` {any} `value`\n\n#### {{itemAt}} Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```\n{{itemAt array 1}}\n//=> 'b'\n\n```\n---\n\n## {{join}}\n\nThe `join` helper is custom to Stencil. It joins an array of string items, with separators. It returns a string. \n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `values`: {Array}\n- `separator`: {String}\n- `limit=<number>`: An optional limit.\n\n#### {{join}} Example\n\ninsert join example\n\n---\n\n### {{limit}}\n\nThe `limit` helper is custom to Stencil. It limits the number of items returned from an array variable, and returns a new array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `data`: {Array}\n- `limit`: {Number}\n\n#### {{limit}} Example \n\nAssume that `{{cart.items}}` would return 10 items. You could use this helper to limit that behavior to only the first four items, by specifying: \n\n```\n{{limit cart.items 4}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{pluck}}\n\nThe `pluck` helper is custom to Stencil. For one or more specified search key(s), it retrieves corresponding values from some or all elements in a specified collection. \n\nThe `pluck` helper returns the retrieved values in a comma-separated string. This helper's general form is:\n\n```\n{{pluck ([limit] <collection> [<limit-value>]) '<search-key>'}}\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `limit`, `limit-value`: Optional parameters to limit the number of results returned.\n- `collection`: The collection to search.\n- `search-key`: The string to search for.\n\n\n#### {{pluck}} Example 1\n\nAssume that the `categories` collection contains:\n\n```\ncategories: [\n  { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Bakeware\" },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cookware\" },\n  { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Cutlery\" }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, this Handlebars statement:\n\n```\n{{pluck (limit categories 2) 'name'}}\n```\n\n...would return:\n\n```\n\"Bakeware,Cookware\"\n```\n\n#### {{pluck}} Example 2\n\nIf the `categories` themselves each contained an image object, then you could use dot notation to access that image object's children:\n\n```\ncategories: [\n  { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Bakeware\", \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Bakeware image\"} },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cookware\" \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Cookware image\"} },\n  { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Cutlery\" \"image\": { \"data\": \"http://...\", \"alt\": \"Cutlery image\"} }\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, this Handlebars statement:\n\n```\n{{pluck (limit categories 2) 'image.data'}}\n```\n\n...would return a comma-separated list of image URLs.\n\n---\n\n\n## <a name=\"array_std\"></a> Standard Array Helpers\n\nThe following standard array helpers are supported on the Stencil framework.\n\n### <a name=\"after\"></a> {{after}}\n\nReturns all of the items in an array after the specified index.

In addition to the current array item, the helper exposes the following variables to the inner block:\n\n* `index`\n* `total`\n* `isFirst`\n* `isLast`\n\nAlso, `@index` is exposed as a private variable, and additional private variables may be defined as hash arguments.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### {{forEach}} Example\n\n```js\nvar accounts = [\n{'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'},\n{'name': 'Malcolm', 'email': 'malcolm@example.com'},\n{'name': 'David', 'email': 'david@example.com'}\n];\n\n// example usage\n// {{#forEach accounts}}\n//   <a href=\"mailto:{{ email }}\" title=\"Send an email to {{ name }}\">\n//     {{ name }}\n//   </a>{{#unless isLast}}, {{/unless}}\n// {{/forEach}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{inArray}}\n\nBlock helper that renders the block if an array has the given `value`. Optionally, you can specify an inverse block to render when the array does not have the given value.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `value` {any}\n* `options` {Object}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### {{inArray}} Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#inArray array \"d\"}}\n  foo\n{{else}}\n  bar\n{{/inArray}}\n//=> 'bar'\n```\n\n---\n\n### {{isArray}}\n\nReturns true if `value` is an es5 array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `value` {any}: The value to test.\n* `returns` {Boolean}\n\n#### Example\n\n```handlebars\n{{isArray \"abc\"}}\n//=> 'false'\n```\n\n### <a name=\"last\"></a> {{last}}\n\nReturns the last item, or last `n` items, of an array. Opposite of [first](#first).\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `n` {Number}: Number of items to return, starting with the last item.\n* `returns` {Array}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{last array 2}}\n//=> '[\"d\", \"e\"]'\n```\n\n### {{lengthEqual}}\n\nBlock helper that compares the length of the given array to the number passed as the second argument. If the array length is equal to the given `length`, the block is returned. Otherwise, you have the option of returning an inverse block.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `length` {Number}\n* `options` {Object}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#lengthEqual array 10}}AAA{{else}}BBB{{/lengthEqual}}\n//=> 'BBB'\n```\n\n### {{map}}\n\nReturns a new array, created by calling `function` on each element of the given `array`.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `fn` {Function}\n* `returns` {String}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven an array `['a', 'b', 'c']`:\n\n```js\n// register `double` as a helper\nfunction double(str) {\n  return str + str;\n}\n// then used like this:\n// {{map array double}}\n//=> '[\"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"]'\n```\n\n### {{some}}\n\nBlock helper that returns the block *if* the callback returns true for some value in the given array.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n* `array` {Array}\n* `cb` {Function}: Callback function.\n* {Options}: Handlebars-provided options object.\n* `returns` {Array}\n\n#### Example\n\nGiven the array `[1, 'b', 3]`:\n\n```handlebars\n{{#some array isString}}\n  Render me if the array has a string.\n{{else}}\n  Render me if it doesn't.\n{{/some}}\n//=> 'Render me if the array has a string.'\n```\n\n### {{sort}}\n\nSorts the given `array`.

Here is a demo of the [BigCommerce Cornerstone theme](http://cornerstone-light-demo.mybigcommerce.com/).\n\nStencil also provides features that allow merchants to customize a storefront's look and feel with no coding, making Stencil a powerful and useful engine for all audiences.",

            "data": "## Stencil Development Features and Technology Stack\n\nStencil's provides the following features, allowing BigCommerce theme developers to create beautiful, dynamic, and powerful storefronts.\n\n\n### Stencil Command Line Interface (Stencil CLI)\n\nThe Stencil CLI enables developers to locally develop and customize on any Stencil theme with no impact on a merchant's live storefront during the development process. When locally developing, you will have access to real-time Browsersync preview and testing across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices/viewports.\n\nStencil CLI runs on the Node.js runtime environment. Installing Node.js also provides the required npm package manager.\n\n### Logic-Based Templates\n\nStencil's logic based templates allow BigCommerce developers to customize storefront pages efficiently with the lightweight templating languge, Handlebars.js.  Handlebars allows you to efficiently embed dynamic and conditional logic onto your storefront pages.\n\n### Sass/SCSS Support\n\nStencils Sass and SCSS support allows developers to nest properties, variables, and mixins. Use the familiar Foundation framework (provided) or substitute your choice of framework.\n\nStencil's Cornerstone base theme uses a BigCommerce pattern library called Citadel, which is built on top of the ZURB Foundation framework, version 5.5.3. Stencil does not support Foundation 6.x, due to breaking changes introduced between versions 5.x and 6.x.\n\nFoundation offers the framework for creating a responsive theme. You have the option of swapping out Foundation for another framework, although doing so would require significant work.\n\nFoundation assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these subdirectories: \n\n* `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/foundation/ `\n* `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/foundation/`\n\nCitadel extends Foundation’s mixins and components to provide Stencil’s own mixins, extensible components, and utilities. These include drop-down lists, forms, and similar resources. Citadel resources are named according to BEM and SUIT CSS conventions. Classes are named functionally, rather than based on visual presentation or content. Our style guide is published here.\nCitadel assets bundled with Cornerstone are located in these Cornerstone subdirectories: \n\n* `Cornerstone/assets/scss/settings/citadel/`\n* `Cornerstone/assets/scss/components/citadel/`\n\nMore detailed information about the Citadel and Foundation SCSS components, and their naming conventions will be covered in *Components and Design Patterns*.\n\n### Page-specific Resource Definition\n\nSpecify the dynamic content you want to be displayed on your storefront pages with YAML formatted front matter.\n\n### Javascript Event Hooks\n\nYour Stencil themes can access remote objects through event hooks, using the hooks to trigger defined events based on shopper behavior. This will allow you to collect product data and optimize a shopper's experience.\n\nTo facilitate theme-building, BigCommerce provides the stencil-utils client-side JavaScript library for managing event hooks.\n\n---\n\n**Stencil Theme Editor**\n\nThe Stencil Theme Editor is a browser-based tool that enables merchants to rapidly customize a theme's look and feel with no coding. \n\nBigCommerce theme developers' configuration choices determine which theme aspects merchants can customize, and the range of choices for each aspect.\n\nStencil's Theme Editor graphical interface enables merchants and store administrators to make styling changes to the theme currently applied to their storefront. \n\nAs a theme developer, you have the capability to define which style settings appear in the Stencil Theme Editor. You can grant access to colors, fonts, display/hiding of page features, and number of products/entries to display per feature.\n\n### Stencil Theme Variations\n\nEach Stencil theme can contain one to four variations. You can optimize individual variations for specific markets, audiences and styles – while still managing and distributing all of these variations as one theme.\nCornerstone comes with 3 variations: Cornerstone Light, Cornerstone Warm, and Cornerstone Bold.\n\n### Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Themes\n\nBigCommerce stores powered by Stencil allow shoppers to have a first class experience across any device.\n\n\n_Note that this is simply a summary Stencil's core features.
